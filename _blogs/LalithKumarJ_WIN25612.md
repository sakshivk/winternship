I never thought that writing an NPTEL exam would bring me this far - to becoming an intern at IIT Ropar, under the guidance of Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar sir. At the time, it was just an exam. I didn’t imagine it would open the door to a journey that would change how I think about learning, life, and myself.

When the internship began, I again had no big expectations. But very soon, I realized this was not going to be a routine internship. It turned into a journey where I genuinely enjoyed each and every day.

The mornings always started with stand-up meetings, and they never felt like pressure. Instead, they felt like a boost - something that brought energy and joy. The games, quizzes, and small interactions made the start of the day positive and refreshing.

What truly stood out to me were Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar sir’s thoughts. He never just spoke about subjects or technology. He spoke about life - ideas like the strength of weak ties, student mindset, placements, and careers. His words gave me a completely different perspective. He didn’t teach us what to think; he changed how we think.

After the stand-ups, the ViBe course felt less like a task and more like a game. Learning the MERN stack through videos and quizzes was something I actually looked forward to. Instead of chasing deadlines, the quizzes at the end of each video gave me confidence. Studying in an environment like ViBe made learning enjoyable, calm, and meaningful.

The evening daily activities added another layer of excitement. Every day, I was curious about what was coming next. The internship never felt repetitive - it always felt new, like a ray of hope pushing me forward.

After the first week, we moved into case studies, and that phase gave me a solid and deeper understanding of MERN. Solving case studies with peers in breakout rooms made learning easier and more fun. We weren’t just solving problems. We were understanding real-world scenarios and thinking about solutions that actually make sense.

There’s a saying: it takes two hands clapping to make a sound. That’s exactly how the case studies felt. Working together made everything clearer and more enjoyable.

I also attended this journey with two of my college friends, Bhavan K and Balasurya G . Each day gave us something to discuss, reflect on, and learn from together. Along the way, I connected with new people like Siva Balan and JAISREE RAGAVI J and many more during breakout rooms. Everyone brought their own perspective, and learning truly became a group activity.

Every single day felt special. It was never just another routine day.

Now, I’m eager to move into the project phase, where I hope to work on projects that solve real-world problems.

This journey wouldn’t have been this smooth without the amazing team behind it. Meenakshi V ma’am’s morning enthusiasm and smile always brightened the stand-ups. Sakshi Sharma ma’am’s health points idea, dashboard and games added fun and motivation. Jinal Gupta mam, Harshdeep Rana mam, and @Bhavana Yedla mam were always kind and supportive. Nitin Sankar sir’s support and guiding words, Rohit Sharma sir’s project ideas, and Nandan Prabhudesai sir’s teaching - especially in ViBe and live sessions played a huge role in shaping this experience. 

I’m deeply thankful to all of them for their guidance, support, and friendliness.

This journey is not just an internship for me. It gave me life lessons, confidence, and a ray of hope to step forward.

I’ll end with a quote that now feels very real to me:

“Life has its own plans, surprises, and magic.” So never sit down - Always explore. One day, you’ll realize that miracles do happen.
