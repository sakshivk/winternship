I didn’t expect the first two weeks of this internship to leave such a lasting impression - but they quietly did.

Somewhere between attending sessions and learning from the ViBe portal, I began noticing small shifts in how I approach learning. Nothing dramatic, just subtle changes that stayed with me even after the sessions ended.

This internship goes beyond just technical knowledge. Along the way, ideas like **collaboration**, **communication**, and **consistency** started to feel just as important.

**Learning felt less like an individual task and more like a shared experience - something that grows better when done together.**

One of the earliest changes I noticed was in my daily routine. I was never someone who could comfortably wake up early, but over time, starting the day earlier stopped feeling difficult. The 8:45 stand-up meetings quickly became a steady, comforting way to start my mornings, accompanied by motivation and encouragement from Sudarshan Sir and Meenakshi Ma’am - setting a calm, positive tone for the day ahead.

The best part is how self-paced and pressure-free everything is. We are allowed to take time to understand concepts, ask questions, and focus on learning - not just finishing tasks.

Certain sessions stood out more than others. Creating dashboards from Google Sheets with Sakshi Ma’am showed how effective simple tools can be when explained clearly. The GitHub and React hands-on session by Nandan Sir made learning feel practical and approachable. These moments made learning engaging and enjoyable.

What truly holds this experience together are the people. The team is patient and supportive, and learning feels open and welcoming. The fellow interns are always ready to help, respond, and encourage each other whether through LinkedIn or the Cliq channel. This sense of collaboration makes learning feel lighter and more joyful.

I am grateful to be a part of **NPTEL's Winter Internship** and thankful for the opportunity to learn in such a thoughtfully designed space. My sincere thanks to **IIT Ropar** and **Sudarshan Sir** for taking us in and creating an environment where learning feels meaningful and motivating.

As this journey continues, I find myself carrying these lessons beyond the sessions - not just in **what** I’m learning, but in **how** I learn. I’m looking forward to the weeks ahead and can’t wait to see what more this internship has in store!
