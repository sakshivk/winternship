## Introduction

Sometimes, opportunities arrive quietly—through consistent effort, curiosity, and a willingness to learn. Looking back at my internship journey, I feel grateful, humbled, and deeply motivated.

As part of my academic curriculum, my college required us to appear for an **NPTEL examination**. I chose **Cloud Computing** as my subject. What started as a mandatory requirement soon became an area of genuine interest. I dedicated myself to understanding the concepts, explored beyond the syllabus, and prepared thoroughly for the examination. When the results were announced, I was pleasantly surprised to score **87%** and receive a **Topper Badge (Top 5%)**. That moment was special—it was a tangible validation of my hard work and learning.

## Summer Internship Opportunity

Shortly after, I received an email from **NPTEL** announcing **Summer Internship opportunities exclusively for course toppers**. I applied with excitement and hope, and I was fortunate to be selected.

My **two-month Summer Internship (May–July)** was under the guidance of **Prof. Sudharshan Sir at IIT Ropar**. During this internship, I gained strong exposure to real-world problem-solving, contributed to an **open-source project**, and learned how academic knowledge translates into practical implementation. Successfully completing the project, receiving the internship certificate, and being awarded a **stipend of ₹10,000** made the experience even more fulfilling.

## An Unexpected Second Opportunity

Just when I thought the journey had reached a milestone, something unexpected happened.

A couple of months later, I received another email—an invitation for the **NPTEL Winter Internship**. I was honestly shocked. Getting an opportunity to intern at an IIT for the **second time**, again under the guidance of the same professor, felt unreal. Coming from a **non-IIT, non-NIT, non-IIIT background**, this experience reinforced my belief that **consistent effort and learning truly matter more than labels**.

## Winter Internship Experience

The **Winter Internship** experience was significantly different and even more enriching. The internship structure evolved into a highly professional and industry-aligned environment that included:

- A complete **MERN stack learning program**
- **Daily stand-up meetings**
- Active communication through **Zoho channels**
- Exposure to a **self-built open-source application**
- Strong collaboration and networking with fellow interns from diverse backgrounds

My daily routine became something I genuinely looked forward to—logging in by **8:45 AM**, participating in team discussions, and working from **9:30 AM to 6:00 PM**, often beyond, driven not by obligation but by enthusiasm to grow and contribute meaningfully.

## Overcoming Initial Fear

On the first day, I felt a sense of nervousness, assuming that most interns would be from highly reputed universities. However, as days passed, I realized something important—**everyone was here to learn**, regardless of their background. That realization boosted my confidence and helped me focus purely on growth rather than comparison.

## Learning Through Practice

What stood out most was the **learning methodology**. Alongside structured MERN stack learning, we were given **real-world case studies**, pushing us to apply concepts practically rather than memorizing theory. This hands-on exposure helped me develop not just technical skills, but also **problem-solving ability, teamwork, and discipline**.

## Reflection and Gratitude

Looking back, I truly feel fortunate to have spent nearly **three months interning under the guidance of an IIT professor and his team**. This journey has shaped my perspective, strengthened my technical foundation, and motivated me to aim higher with clarity and confidence.

I am deeply grateful to **NPTEL**, **Prof. Sudharshan Sir**, the internship team, and my fellow interns for making this journey memorable. This experience will always remain a milestone in my learning journey.

## Closing Note

Here’s to **continuous learning**, staying curious, and believing in the **power of consistent effort**.
