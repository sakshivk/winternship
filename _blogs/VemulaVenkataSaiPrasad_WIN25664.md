Not all learning happens in classrooms. Some of the most impactful lessons come from structured experiences that challenge both **skill and mindset**. My experience during the **NPTEL Winter Internship at IIT Ropar**, under the guidance of **Professor Sudarshan Iyengar**, reshaped my daily routine, strengthened my confidence, and encouraged consistent learning. This article reflects on that journey—filled with **meaningful changes, real challenges, and deep gratitude**.

### **The Unexpected Start: From Doubt to Enthusiasm**

It began with a suggestion from my professor to take the **NPTEL Programming in Java exam**. At first, my friends and I hesitated due to the **effort and cost involved**. But we decided to try it. To our surprise, we all did well—earning spots in the **Elite + Gold category** and invitations to this **prestigious internship**.

When the selection email came, I felt a wave of **excitement and disbelief**. This virtual program at **IIT Ropar** turned out to feel like **living my IIT dream**, right from my laptop.

The internship began on **December 22, 2025**, with a **9 AM Zoom meeting**. I was anxious—*could I keep up?* But the first session, led by the engaging **Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar sir**, changed everything. His encouraging words, along with support from **Meenakshi V Mam** and the team, eased my worries. Soon, **starting my day early** became something I genuinely looked forward to.

### **Daily Lessons: From Skills to Self-Improvement**

This is **not a standard internship** with simple lectures and a certificate. It is **hands-on and well-organized**, built around the **ViBe platform**—short videos, focused quizzes, and tools that kept us on track.

We covered a **modern course on the MERN stack**, expertly taught by **Nandan Prabhudesai Sir**, working through **challenging case studies** that tested my limits. The **React modules** were tough at times, but **breakout rooms** led to lively discussions where fellow interns helped explain ideas clearly. In a short time, I completed the **entire MERN module**—something I once believed was out of reach.

### **Beyond Coding: Skills That Truly Matter**

**Teamwork:**  
Breakout rooms sparked **lively discussions** with interns from all over India, often lasting late into the night. Sharing ideas, fixing code issues, and expanding my network through **LinkedIn** helped me connect more during this program than in my entire **BTech journey so far**.

**Building Habits and Confidence:**  
Daily meetings built **discipline without pressure**. I overcame challenges like microphone issues and the fear of losing points to **speak up confidently**—hoping **Sudarshan Sir** would notice my name in the list! These small wins greatly strengthened my **self-belief**.

We also had open interactions with mentors including **Jinal Gupta**, **Nitin Sankar**, and the team at **Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design**. Activities like **polls, quizzes, and group tasks** kept sessions engaging and built a strong sense of **community across distances**.

### **Reflections: A Clearer Mind and Stronger Focus**

I can already see clear improvements—**better focus, reduced procrastination, and satisfaction after completing tough case studies**. My daily routine shifted from **irregular study hours** to **consistent, goal-driven effort**.

This internship was about **more than technical skills**. It reshaped **how I think and approach challenges**. It taught me that real progress comes from **collaboration, patience, and persistence**.

I truly hope the bonds—both **professional and personal**—last long after the program. A heartfelt thanks to the entire team, including **Harshdeep R.** and **Nitin Sankar**, for creating such a **supportive and inspiring environment**. Your dedication genuinely made a difference.

This experience has motivated me to **keep learning, growing, and improving every single day**.
