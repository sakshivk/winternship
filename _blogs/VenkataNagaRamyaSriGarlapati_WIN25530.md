# My Online Internship Experience at IIT Ropar

Hello all, I am here to share my genuine and honest experience of my internship. I recently got an opportunity for an internship at IIT Ropar. But one thing that makes me sad is that it is completely online. But you know what? Conducting an online internship makes you more lucky. You might think about this statement, but I will let you know how this is lucky by the end of this blog.

By seeing the offer letter, I thought that it was just a normal internship where you have to learn from some sources and then start working on a project, and when you are finally done with that project, you will receive the certificate. But this is not like that. Being a final-year student, managing all the things might be very difficult.

On the first day of the internship, the timings were 9 am to 6 pm continuously, with some short breaks. So, I was really afraid of these timings and felt very sad, thinking that I would not have time for my self-preparation.

On the first day, I met Professor Sudarshan Iyengar sir. He inaugurated the session, and he is one of my favorite professors because when I visited IIT Madras, he taught us a lecture which was very interesting. After the class, I wished to talk to the sir, but it was not fulfilled. I am thinking about how lucky I was again, being selected for the internship under the same professor.

Initially, they said to complete some modern courses on the Y platform, which was really challenging, but the experience was amazing. It is not like the other platforms. It aims in a way that the student should be focused and not get distracted. After that, they gave case studies on each topic, which really improved my practical knowledge in the topics, because just listening to the courses can give you only half knowledge without practicing anything.

We have completed only two weeks of the internship. You know what, in these two weeks, I have learned a lot. It not only improved my subject knowledge, but it also improved my daily routine and my focus. Life before and after the internship is not the same; it is completely different.

I am attending the daily stand-ups at sharp 9 am and turning on our videos, not because of their orders, but because of my pure interest and excitement to join the session. Our teachers—Professor Sudarshan Iyengar Sir, Meenakshi Ma'am, Sakshi Ma'am, Bhavna Ma'am, Harshadeep Ma'am, Jinal Gupta Ma'am, Nitin Shankar Sir—and last but not the least, the fellow interns, make these sessions much more interesting day by day. They are coming up with more interesting activities. They conduct polls during the Zoom sessions, conduct quizzes, and also conduct sessions on learning new things.

The most important thing I want to mention is about my fellow interns. We got the chance to interact with diverse people with diverse mindsets all over India. We have connected through LinkedIn, and we all improved our networking. The most lovely thing is that we have the opportunity to discuss, learn, share our knowledge, and debug our problems or code. All this happened with the help of breakout rooms. I have learned a lot by discussing with them and knowing new things. You might wonder that we have discussions up to 2 am at midnight.

Overall, the learning experience is very, very good. It completely changed the way I think and focus. Actually, studying in an IIT is a dream for me, and I think it was fulfilled in this way. But it is very sad that only two weeks are left. But we can’t change it, right? I hope the interactions with our fellow interns will continue for sure.

One thing I forgot is that if the internship is offline, we do not have the opportunity to interact with the sir all the time, and with all the teachers who were very soft, very sweet, and very kind-hearted. Also, you do not have the option of late-night discussions like breakout rooms.

I really want to express my utmost gratitude and thankfulness to all the teachers who are working hard for our sake. I want to say, don’t lose this opportunity. I really recommend joining this internship. It will change you a lot for sure. If you lose this internship, you can lose a lot for sure. Thank you for the opportunity to express our thoughts in this internship.
