# My Online Internship Experience at IIT Ropar

Hello everyone, I would like to share my genuine and honest experience from my internship. I recently got an opportunity to do an internship at IIT Ropar. At first, I felt a little sad because the internship was completely online. But later, I realized that an online internship can actually be very beneficial. You might not agree at first, but by the end of this blog, you’ll understand why I feel this way.

When I saw the offer letter, I thought it would be a normal internship where we learn from some materials, work on a project, and finally get a certificate. But this internship was very different. As a final-year student, managing college work along with an internship is not easy.

On the first day, the internship timing was from 9 am to 6 pm with only short breaks. This made me nervous, and I felt worried that I wouldn’t get enough time for my own preparation.

On the same day, I met Professor Sudarshan Iyengar sir, who started the session. He is one of my favorite professors because earlier, when I visited IIT Madras, I attended one of his lectures and really enjoyed it. At that time, I wanted to talk to him but couldn’t. So, getting selected for an internship under his guidance later felt very special and lucky to me.

At the beginning of the internship, we were asked to complete some modern courses on the ViBe platform. These course was challenging, but the learning experience was really good. The platform is designed in a way that helps students stay focused without getting distracted. Along with the courses, we were also given case studies for each topic. These helped me understand the concepts better because just listening to lectures is not enough without practice.

Even though we have completed only two weeks of the internship, I have learned a lot during this time. It has improved not only my subject knowledge but also my daily routine and concentration. There is a clear difference in my life before and after the internship.

I am attending the daily stand-ups at sharp 9 am and turning on our videos, not because it is compulsory, but because of my pure interest and excitement to join the session. Our teachers— Sudarshan Iyengar Sir, Meenakshi V Ma'am, Sakshi Sharma Ma'am, @Bhavna Ma'am, @Harshadeep Ma'am, Jinal Gupta Ma'am, Nitin Sankar Sir—and last but not the least, the fellow interns, make these sessions much more interesting day by day. They are coming up with more interesting activities. They conduct polls during the Zoom sessions, conduct quizzes, and also conduct sessions on learning new things. Also I want to specially thank Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design for providng us this smooth experience and providing valuable insights.

One of the best parts of this internship is interacting with fellow interns. We got the chance to connect with people from different parts of India and with different ways of thinking. We connected on LinkedIn and improved our networking. The most enjoyable part was discussing ideas, learning together, sharing knowledge, and solving problems or code in breakout rooms. Sometimes, our discussions even went on till 2 am at night.

Overall, the learning experience has been very good. It changed the way I think and focus. Studying in an IIT has always been my dream, and in some way, this internship made that dream come true. It feels a little sad that only two weeks are left, but that’s something we can’t change. I truly hope that the connections we built with fellow interns continue even after the internship ends.

One more thing I want to mention is that if this internship were offline, we might not have had so many chances to interact with our professors so freely. All the teachers were very kind, supportive, and friendly. Also, late-night discussions like the ones we had in breakout rooms wouldn’t have been possible.

I would like to sincerely thank all the teachers for their hard work and support. I strongly recommend not missing this opportunity. This internship can really help you grow and learn a lot. Missing it would mean missing something valuable. 

Thank you for giving me the chance to share my experience through this internship.
