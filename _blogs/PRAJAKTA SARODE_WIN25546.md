I am Prajakta, a second-year (4th semester) Computer Engineering student. This internship with VLED Lab at IIT Ropar is my first internship ever, and even now, writing that feels a little unreal.

When my NPTEL results came out and I found myself in the Top 5% category, I was happy. My family was happy. Everyone felt proud. At that moment, I knew something good might come out of it—but I didn’t know how or when. A few months later, an email arrived. I registered, received the offer letter, and just like that, I stepped into my first professional learning experience. 

Before joining, I was extremely excited and curious. I kept wondering—what will we learn, how will this be different, what will people be like? Then came Day 1: the orientation. It felt energetic, welcoming, and motivating. The mentors and the people I met didn’t feel distant or intimidating. They felt real, approachable, and genuinely invested. 

One thing that stood out from the very beginning was the daily morning sessions on Zoom. They don’t feel like routine meetings. They carry a certain positivity that lifts my mood every day. Everyone gets a chance to share experiences, thoughts, or doubts. Initially, I was hesitant to speak. I overthought—What if I say something wrong? What if people judge? But as I saw others sharing openly, I gathered the courage to speak once. 

That one time changed everything. 

After sharing my experience, the hesitation slowly disappeared. Now, if I have a doubt—or even if someone else has one—I feel confident enough to raise my hand, speak, or answer. I don’t think twice anymore about how people will react. Somewhere along the way, I gained confidence I didn’t even realise I was building. 

I still remember a moment from the very first day when someone asked why we need to learn development when AI exists and might replace us. The discussion that followed made one thing clear—AI cannot work without human logic and reasoning. There will always be gaps that need human thinking. That conversation reassured me and strengthened my belief in learning core skills. 

Our technical learning began with MERN stack development on the ViBe platform. The videos are short, focused, and engaging, followed by quizzes that ensure active learning. If you move away or speak loudly, the video rewinds. At first, it felt strict, but soon I realised how effective it was. 

In the first two days, there were some enrollment issues, but what mattered was how the team handled them. Those who weren’t enrolled yet were given live sessions, which showed genuine concern for our learning. 

Initially, deadlines were given, but later they were removed and everything became self-paced. This shift taught me self-discipline—no pressure, no chasing, just responsibility. We were also introduced to case studies and breakout rooms where people discuss, collaborate, and learn together. I joined a few sessions, and each time I gained a new perspective. 

During one session, we discussed the idea of the strength of weak ties. Over time, I began seeing it in action. Mentors, peers from different colleges, and teammates in breakout rooms—people I barely knew at the start—have influenced my learning and thinking through small but meaningful interactions. 

If I reflect on what I’ve learned so far, it’s not just technical knowledge—though MERN stack was completely new to me and now I understand its concepts. More importantly, I’ve learned to speak up, trust my voice, and share my thoughts confidently. 

As I move forward in this internship, my next milestone is the viva—not just as an evaluation, but as a doorway to real project work. Clearing it means that learning will turn into responsibility, where I’ll be expected to contribute meaningfully. That thought excites me and scares me at the same time, but it has also made me more aware that what is expected from me is not perfection, but initiative, clarity, and the willingness to take responsibility, even in small ways. 

In just two weeks, this internship has begun to influence how learning, growth, and responsibility are understood. With the journey still ongoing, there is much more to learn and experience.✨
