DISCLAIMER: This blog might be long, but it is from my heart.

I precisely remember it to be the 15th of October,2025, and we were waiting with anticipation for NPTEL to publish the list of candidates who had been shortlisted for that year's winter Internship. As the anticipation kept growing so did my curiousity to know what am i supposed to be pre-equipped with incase I get shortlisted.So it was on that this day that I mustered up some courage and dropped a message to Sudarshan sir on LinkedIn as follows:

As expected, I knew it for certain that an IIT Professor would surely be a pretty busy person and hence I just waited for the Internship to begin and to go with the flow.

_Learning on the fly, The Deer effect, Grit and Perseverance over passion._  
_In fact I maintained a diary to take note of important technical things in the Internship but then ended up the first two pages only with the enormously fantastic ideas that were popped up in our stand-up sessions:_

By the end of the first day, I made up my mind and also told my parents that I would want to skip my semester end examinations , take up this Internship seriously have backlogs, get a year back and go and clear them next year ! (but thankfully that didn't happen and things somehow just worked out !)

One of our projects, which in turn was our learning platform too, called ViBe (named after the legendary story of Vikram Bethal) turned out to be very interesting and fun at the start but as and when I proceeded it got frustrating at times, I would shamelessly watch a lecture at least 7-8 times and still make a mistake in the quiz and go back, but looking at the other side of the coin, it is this very platform that helped me over come my doom – scrolling. I with utmost honestly confess that I used to Doom Scroll to the extent that I would be left thinking, _am I using the phone or is the phone using me?._ I don’t know what algorithm or magical mantra this platform has used , but I know longer get that urge to scroll.  

Solving of case studies I must say, was one really important factor that built my grit and thought me how to keep things going even when they seem to be tough !, we were a group of around 4-5 people Karthik bhaiya, Krishna didi, Shruti didi, Inchara akka and we would solve the case studies together, many a times when we would get stuck and then we decide to hit the basics from scratch again. From Reading documentations to watching youtube tutorials and what not. I still remember one unforgettable incident where we were watching a youtube lecture on the introduction to React and the lecturer saying “_React kya hai ?... Kuch bhi nahi hai_”, that got us laughing a lot .  
  
Helping my peers and most importantly helping just for the sake of helping and no other hidden motive was something that truly helped me out learn concepts much faster, It kind of gave me a catalyst effect. Indeed true is the quote that states “_I helped a man climb a mountain and found that I too had reached the top_ !”

My humble pranaams to Sudarshan sir and his revered team , Meenakshi mam, Nitin sir, Jinal mam, Harshdeep mam, Nandan sir ,Bhavana mam and all the other unsung heroes behind the scenes for helping me realise that with perseverance, Grit and an iron will, literally anything could be achieved, literally anything…  
It is truly then when **_sky is no more our limit, its our base !_**
