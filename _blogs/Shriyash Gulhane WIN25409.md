# From User to Developer: Week 1 IIT Ropar Internship Recap


We tested two products developed at Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar under Sudarshan Iyengar specifically designed for Gen Z learning. Now that we have used these products ourselves, we are ready to contribute to these open-source projects on GitHub.

These products were designed following extensive research into the unique learning challenges and short attention spans of Gen Z.

**𝐕𝐢𝐁𝐞**: A Modern Learning Platform ViBe is open-source software designed to replace conventional teaching with more engaging, AI-driven methods. It transforms long lectures into short, manageable chunks and adds AI-generated, context-aware questions to keep learners actively involved.

It even tracks attention levels, helping teachers ensure every student stays focused.

**𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐦**: Real-Time Engagement, AI-integrated web application for conducting live polls during online sessions. This system creates polls at key moments based on the ongoing Zoom meeting to keep participants engaged and attentive.
