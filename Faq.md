## 2. Mode of Internship & Attendance

**2.1 Can we opt for an on-campus/offline internship?**  
The program will be conducted strictly in **online mode**.

**2.2 Is my attendance at online sessions compulsory?**  

Yes, attendance at every online session is **mandatory**. Attendance will be counted **only if your camera remains ON for the entire Zoom session**. If the camera is not switched on for a sustained duration, the session may **not be considered as full attendance**.

Please note that attendance recorded until now (30.12.2025) is **provisional** and may be reviewed based on camera activity, consistency, and overall participation.

Up to **two warnings** may be issued for non-compliance. Further violations may result in **termination**.


**2.3 I registered using one name but attend sessions with a different name or email. Will this affect my attendance?**  
Yes. You must attend using the **same name and email ID** used during NPTEL registration.

**2.4 Should I fill the attendance sheet attached to the NPTEL offer letter?**  
Yes. You must fill the **Google Form provided in the NPTEL offer letter** **every day** during your internship (**except Sundays**).

Guidelines:
- Fill in all required details **daily**
- The form should be preferably filled **in the evening**, after completing the day’s work
- This form is **mandatory** for marking your attendance on **NPTEL’s side** throughout the internship

**2.5 I forgot to fill the attendance sheet attached to the NPTEL offer letter yesterday. What should I do now?**  
Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done, as the form is used for **NPTEL’s official database** and attendance **cannot be recorded for the previous day**. The previous day will be considered as a leave and two such days will automatically lead to termination.

Please ensure that the form is filled **daily** going forward to avoid missing attendance again.

**2.6 How can I avail the one-day leave allowed during the internship?**  
Taking leave is **discouraged**, as you may miss important updates shared during live sessions or fall behind in your progress. It will be **your own responsibility** to complete the work missed on the leave day.

However, if you must take the leave, follow the steps below:

- Write a message in the **main Cliq Channel** stating the reason for your leave
- Tag **@Nitin Sankar A** sir, **@Jinal Gupta** ma’am, and **@Harshdeep R** ma’am in the message
- Post the request **at least one day in advance**
- Clearly mention:
  - The **reason** for the leave
  - The **exact date** on which you intend to take the leave

Once submitted, the request will be reviewed and processed by the team.

---

## 8. Termination, Appeals & Rejoining

**8.1 Can I be terminated due to academic overlap (exams, college work, etc.)?**  
Yes. Any **academic overlap** that affects attendance or participation will result in **termination**, as this internship requires full-time commitment.

**8.2 Can I be terminated due to attendance issues?**  
Yes. Interns who are found to be **fully absent for three or more working days on Zoom**, based on verified and auditable attendance records, may be **removed from the internship**.  
Relevant communication regarding such actions is sent **only via official email**.

**8.3 Can I appeal a termination related to attendance?**  
Yes, **only in specific cases**. If you genuinely believe there has been an error in the attendance records and you have attended the sessions as required, you may submit an appeal **exclusively through the official Google Form shared with you via email**.

Please note:
- Appeals raised on **Cliq or any other platform will not be entertained**
- Appeals are accepted **only through the official Google Form**
- Each appeal triggers a **detailed re-verification** of Zoom attendance logs and session recordings

If, after re-verification, non-attendance is confirmed, the appeal may be viewed as a **lack of due diligence** and an **unnecessary use of institutional time**, and the matter **may be escalated** to the relevant academic authorities for appropriate action.

**8.4 What should I do if I receive an email regarding termination or appeal?**  
If you have received such an email:
- Kindly **exit the Cliq group**
- Continue all further communication **strictly via email**

## 9. ViBe Platform

**9.1 How do I log in to ViBe?**  
Invite link → Continue as Student → Continue with Google → Dashboard.

**9.2 Invite accepted but shows “No course enrolled”?**  
Verify email → Check alias → Contact Support.

**9.3 Why are videos stuck or repeating?**  
Sequential viewing, camera/mic access, lighting, and noise conditions matter.

**9.4 Can I use mobile or tablet?**  
No. Only **desktop/laptop** is supported.

**9.5 I'm experiencing video issues (stuck, looping, skipping) on ViBe. How do I troubleshoot?**  
Try these troubleshooting steps in order:

1. **Refresh the page** and check multiple times
2. **Inspect browser console**: Right-click → Inspect → Go to Network or Console tab → Try watching the video and check for any visible errors
3. **Log out and log in again**
4. **Use a different browser**
5. **Clear browsing data and cache**, then try to re-login

If the issue persists after trying all steps, **record the issue** and email it to: **internship-support@vicharanashala.zohodesk.in** between **9:00 AM and 9:00 PM**.

**9.6 I have completed all videos and quizzes in the ViBe course, but my progress is still showing less than 100%. What should I do?**  

Please do not worry. This is a **dashboard-level technical issue** that has already been acknowledged by the support team and communicated in the Cliq threads. The team is actively working on resolving it, and your progress will be **updated automatically** once the issue is fixed.

In the meantime, you may try the following steps once:

1. **Refresh your browser**
2. **Log out**, clear your browser cache, and **log in again**

If the issue still persists after these steps, no further action is required from your side. Your course completion status will be corrected by the support team shortly.

**9.7 What is the deadline to complete the course from the ViBe platform?**  

The course does not have a single hard deadline. Instead, it is divided into **progress-based milestones**, where learners are required to reach a certain percentage of completion by specific dates.  
**Failure to meet these milestones may lead to termination from the program.**

The milestones are as follows:

| Date   | Required ViBe Progress (≥) |
|--------|----------------------------|
| 29 Dec | 20% |
| 30 Dec | 30% |
| 31 Dec | 40% |
| 01 Jan | 50% |
| 02 Jan | 60% |
| 03 Jan | 70% |
| 04 Jan | 80% |
| 05 Jan | 90% |
| 06 Jan | 100% |

However, **do not focus only on deadlines**. Meeting milestones is **not the ultimate goal** of this course.  
The primary objective is to **introduce you to the MERN stack** and help you build a strong foundation in its core technical concepts — not to create unnecessary pressure.

These milestones are set **only to ensure that learners do not fall behind**, to maintain **steady progress**, and to encourage **healthy competition** while ensuring everyone improves consistently each day.

Treat your learning journey as a **marathon, not a race**.

## 14. Viva/PES (Endorsements)

**14.1 How will the viva/evaluation process be conducted?**  
Each intern is required to **select at least 5 evaluators (other interns)** who will evaluate their work, primarily based on their **case studies** solutions. Hence, make sure you are completed with all the Case studies before you evaluate someone or get evaluated yourself.

**14.2 What is the role of the evaluators?**  
The evaluators are expected to be **sincere** and give their **best effort** while evaluating the case studies.  
The evaluation is mainly an **endorsement of learning**, not a formal grading process.

**14.3 Will the evaluations be verified?**  
Yes. The team will **randomly second-check** evaluated case studies.  
If any **anomaly** is detected, the following actions may be taken:
- Re-evaluation of the evaluated intern’s case studies  
- Re-evaluation of the evaluator’s own case studies  
- Re-evaluation of all case studies previously evaluated by that evaluator  

To avoid such an **anomaly cascade**, choose your evaluators carefully.

**14.4 Can two interns evaluate each other?**  
No. If **A evaluates B**, then **B cannot evaluate A**.

**14.5 Can I choose evaluators from my own institute?**  
Preferably, **no**.  
Choosing evaluators from your own institute may raise a **first level of suspicion**. While this is **discouraged**, it is **not enforced as a strict rule**.

**14.6 How many evaluators do I need?**  
You need **exactly 5 evaluators to endorse you**.  
If any selected person is unwilling to endorse you, you must **find a replacement**.  
Overall, you must ensure that **at least 5 people endorse your learning**.

**14.7 What does the endorsement involve?**  
Your evaluators will fill out a **Google Form** stating that they **endorse your learning**.  
- There is **no rating or scoring**
- Evaluators may add **optional comments**
- Endorsements will be submitted through a form that will be **displayed on the dashboard**

**14.8 When should the evaluation be done?**  
It is recommended to evaluate **only after completing all case studies** or once you are **confident in the concepts**.

**14.9 Do we need to record our evaluation interactions?**  
No. You only need to **interact and endorse** the person.  
How you conduct the interaction is **entirely up to you**. No recordings are required.

**14.10 Can I appeal an endorsement decision?**  
No.  
This is intentional, as interns are expected to choose **trustworthy evaluators** who will endorse them **honestly and fairly**.

**14.11 Can I evaluate more than 5 people?**  
Yes.  
You must be evaluated by **exactly 5 people**, but you may **evaluate as many interns as you wish**.

**14.12 What if I want to remove an endorsement or someone endorses me without my consent?**  
You will be provided with a **separate form** that allows you to **remove an endorsement** made by a particular person.

**14.13 What if I evaluate many people but struggle to find evaluators for myself?**  
The teaching team **appreciates interns who evaluate many peers**.  
In such cases, **teaching team members** can be requested to act as your evaluators.

Additionally, **Silver and Golden Tickets** will be issued to selected interns.  
- Interns receiving these tickets **do not need peer evaluation**
- They will be **directly evaluated by Sudarshan sir and the teaching team**
- Anyone who endorses **more than 25 people** will be evaluated by the Teaching Team and will be issued a Silver Ticket.

**14.14 How do I earn a Silver ticket?**  
Anyone who endorses **more than 25 people** will be evaluated by the Teaching Team and will be issued a Silver Ticket.
