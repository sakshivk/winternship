<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Sometimes, opportunities arrive quietly—through consistent effort, curiosity, and a willingness to learn. Looking back at my internship journey, I feel grateful, humbled, and deeply motivated.</p>

<p>As part of my academic curriculum, my college required us to appear for an <strong>NPTEL examination</strong>. I chose <strong>Cloud Computing</strong> as my subject. What started as a mandatory requirement soon became an area of genuine interest. I dedicated myself to understanding the concepts, explored beyond the syllabus, and prepared thoroughly for the examination. When the results were announced, I was pleasantly surprised to score <strong>87%</strong> and receive a <strong>Topper Badge (Top 5%)</strong>. That moment was special—it was a tangible validation of my hard work and learning.</p>

<h2 id="summer-internship-opportunity">Summer Internship Opportunity</h2>

<p>Shortly after, I received an email from <strong>NPTEL</strong> announcing <strong>Summer Internship opportunities exclusively for course toppers</strong>. I applied with excitement and hope, and I was fortunate to be selected.</p>

<p>My <strong>two-month Summer Internship (May–July)</strong> was under the guidance of <strong>Prof. Sudharshan Sir at IIT Ropar</strong>. During this internship, I gained strong exposure to real-world problem-solving, contributed to an <strong>open-source project</strong>, and learned how academic knowledge translates into practical implementation. Successfully completing the project, receiving the internship certificate, and being awarded a <strong>stipend of ₹10,000</strong> made the experience even more fulfilling.</p>

<h2 id="an-unexpected-second-opportunity">An Unexpected Second Opportunity</h2>

<p>Just when I thought the journey had reached a milestone, something unexpected happened.</p>

<p>A couple of months later, I received another email—an invitation for the <strong>NPTEL Winter Internship</strong>. I was honestly shocked. Getting an opportunity to intern at an IIT for the <strong>second time</strong>, again under the guidance of the same professor, felt unreal. Coming from a <strong>non-IIT, non-NIT, non-IIIT background</strong>, this experience reinforced my belief that <strong>consistent effort and learning truly matter more than labels</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="winter-internship-experience">Winter Internship Experience</h2>

<p>The <strong>Winter Internship</strong> experience was significantly different and even more enriching. The internship structure evolved into a highly professional and industry-aligned environment that included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A complete <strong>MERN stack learning program</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Daily stand-up meetings</strong></li>
  <li>Active communication through <strong>Zoho channels</strong></li>
  <li>Exposure to a <strong>self-built open-source application</strong></li>
  <li>Strong collaboration and networking with fellow interns from diverse backgrounds</li>
</ul>

<p>My daily routine became something I genuinely looked forward to—logging in by <strong>8:45 AM</strong>, participating in team discussions, and working from <strong>9:30 AM to 6:00 PM</strong>, often beyond, driven not by obligation but by enthusiasm to grow and contribute meaningfully.</p>

<h2 id="overcoming-initial-fear">Overcoming Initial Fear</h2>

<p>On the first day, I felt a sense of nervousness, assuming that most interns would be from highly reputed universities. However, as days passed, I realized something important—<strong>everyone was here to learn</strong>, regardless of their background. That realization boosted my confidence and helped me focus purely on growth rather than comparison.</p>

<h2 id="learning-through-practice">Learning Through Practice</h2>

<p>What stood out most was the <strong>learning methodology</strong>. Alongside structured MERN stack learning, we were given <strong>real-world case studies</strong>, pushing us to apply concepts practically rather than memorizing theory. This hands-on exposure helped me develop not just technical skills, but also <strong>problem-solving ability, teamwork, and discipline</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="reflection-and-gratitude">Reflection and Gratitude</h2>

<p>Looking back, I truly feel fortunate to have spent nearly <strong>three months interning under the guidance of an IIT professor and his team</strong>. This journey has shaped my perspective, strengthened my technical foundation, and motivated me to aim higher with clarity and confidence.</p>

<p>I am deeply grateful to <strong>NPTEL</strong>, <strong>Prof. Sudharshan Sir</strong>, the internship team, and my fellow interns for making this journey memorable. This experience will always remain a milestone in my learning journey.</p>

<h2 id="closing-note">Closing Note</h2>

<p>Here’s to <strong>continuous learning</strong>, staying curious, and believing in the <strong>power of consistent effort</strong>.</p>
