<h4 id="writing-a-blog-as-part-of-your-nptel-internship-journey-with-vled-lab"><strong>Writing a Blog as Part of Your NPTEL Internship Journey with VLED Lab</strong></h4>
<p><small><em>(Activity: Call for Blogs)</em></small></p>

<p><img src="../Blog_image.jpg" alt="Blog Writing" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; display: block;" /></p>

<p>As part of your internship with the <strong>VLED Lab</strong>, we are opening a <strong>Call for Blogs</strong>—an invitation for you to pause, reflect, and put your journey into words. This activity is not about technical writing skills or perfect grammar. It is about <strong>capturing your experience honestly</strong>, in your own voice, as you lived through this internship.</p>

<h4 id="the-journey"><strong>The Journey</strong></h4>

<p>This internship has been intentionally designed as a learning journey rather than a checklist. You began with a fully hands-on <strong>MERN stack course delivered through ViBe</strong>, where learning happened through practice and persistence. You then moved into solving <strong>case studies</strong>, which required you to think, reason, and struggle like a developer. This was followed by a <strong>viva</strong>, where your understanding and clarity were tested through conversation rather than code alone. For those who cleared the viva, the journey extended further—into <strong>real project work alongside our developers</strong>, where learning became responsibility.
Along the way, many experiences quietly shaped you. Learning on ViBe, submitting code regularly, navigating case studies, attending sessions consistently, discussing ideas in breakout rooms, preparing for the viva, receiving feedback, and working in teams—each of these meant something different to each of you. That difference is what makes your story worth telling.
To help you reflect, you may think about experiences such as learning through ViBe, working through the MERN course, solving case studies, handling coding submissions, participating in breakout room discussions, understanding the role of attendance and consistency, facing the viva, or contributing to real projects. These are only prompts to help you remember. Do not pick any of these as your blog topic directly. Writing on the “easiest” idea is not the goal. Writing from your heart is.</p>

<p>What we are <strong>not looking for</strong> is a summary of the internship or a step-by-step description of what happened.</p>

<p>What we <strong>are looking for</strong> is your lived experience—your doubts, your growth, your surprises, and your takeaways. Write about what stayed with you after the sessions ended. Write about moments that changed how you think or learn. Write as if you are speaking to someone who has never experienced learning in this way.</p>

<h4 id="review-feedback-and-publication"><strong>Review, Feedback, and Publication</strong></h4>

<p>Your blog should first appear on your LinkedIn profile under the article section. You should tag VLED lab and it’s members in your article. If we found the article interesting, inspiring and aligning with the Winternship. We will select your submitted blog and it will be <strong>reviewed by the VLED Lab team</strong>. You will receive <strong>comments and suggestions to help you improve your writing and clarity</strong>. This is part of the learning process—we see writing as something that evolves through feedback, just like code.</p>

<p>Blogs that are selected after review will be <strong>published on the Winternship website under the Blogs section</strong>. Additionally, <strong>selected blogs will be recognised for their</strong> thoughtful reflection, originality, and authenticity.</p>

<h4 id="submission-instructions"><strong>Submission Instructions</strong></h4>

<p>You are first required to publish your blog on your LinkedIn under the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/article/new/" target="_blank">Article</a> section and then you are required to submit your blog as <strong>Markdown file</strong> to <strong>Winternship</strong> GitHub repository as a new pull request. Your blog will be rendered as a webpage, so ensure it is readable, well-structured, and personal. Follow the folder structure, naming conventions, and file structure provided below. Each blog must be written individually and should reflect your own journey.</p>

        <p>I didn’t expect the first two weeks of this internship to leave such a lasting impression - but they quietly did.</p>

<p>Somewhere between attending sessions and learning from the ViBe portal, I began noticing small shifts in how I approach learning. Nothing dramatic, just subtle changes that stayed with me even after the sessions ended.</p>

<p>This internship goes beyond just technical knowledge. Along the way, ideas like <strong>collaboration</strong>, <strong>communication</strong>, and <strong>consistency</strong> started to feel just as important.</p>

<p><strong>Learning felt less like an individual task and more like a shared experience - something that grows better when done together.</strong></p>

<p>One of the earliest changes I noticed was in my daily routine. I was never someone who could comfortably wake up early, but over time, starting the day earlier stopped feeling difficult. The 8:45 stand-up meetings quickly became a steady, comforting way to start my mornings, accompanied by motivation and encouragement from Sudarshan Sir and Meenakshi Ma’am - setting a calm, positive tone for the day ahead.</p>

<p>The best part is how self-paced and pressure-free everything is. We are allowed to take time to understand concepts, ask questions, and focus on learning - not just finishing tasks.</p>

<p>Certain sessions stood out more than others. Creating dashboards from Google Sheets with Sakshi Ma’am showed how effective simple tools can be when explained clearly. The GitHub and React hands-on session by Nandan Sir made learning feel practical and approachable. These moments made learning engaging and enjoyable.</p>

<p>What truly holds this experience together are the people. The team is patient and supportive, and learning feels open and welcoming. The fellow interns are always ready to help, respond, and encourage each other whether through LinkedIn or the Cliq channel. This sense of collaboration makes learning feel lighter and more joyful.</p>

<p>I am grateful to be a part of <strong>NPTEL’s Winter Internship</strong> and thankful for the opportunity to learn in such a thoughtfully designed space. My sincere thanks to <strong>IIT Ropar</strong> and <strong>Sudarshan Sir</strong> for taking us in and creating an environment where learning feels meaningful and motivating.</p>

<p>As this journey continues, I find myself carrying these lessons beyond the sessions - not just in <strong>what</strong> I’m learning, but in <strong>how</strong> I learn. I’m looking forward to the weeks ahead and can’t wait to see what more this internship has in store!

        <p>This internship began for me even before the first session started.</p>

<p>I still remember how excited I felt when I received the NOC from my college. That excitement came with relief and gratitude, especially towards my college and our Principal Madam, who took the initiative to make this internship possible for me. On the very first day of the internship, I had my end-semester practical examination. Without that support, I would not have been able to attend the inaugural session at all. That moment itself made this journey feel important and personal.</p>

<p>This is my <strong>first internship</strong>, and I came into it with no prior experience. Naturally, I was nervous. Not the kind of nervousness that disappears after introductions, but the quiet kind — wondering whether I would be able to keep up, whether I was learning “fast enough,” and whether I truly belonged here.</p>

<p>The learning on the <strong>ViBe platform</strong> taught me something unexpected: learning does not always have to be fast to be real. In the beginning, I watched the videos slowly. Sometimes I paused, replayed, and questioned myself more than the content. At times, it felt like others were moving ahead while I was still trying to understand the basics. But gradually, something shifted. Concepts started connecting. Things that once felt heavy began to feel familiar. Without realizing it, I had improved.</p>

<p>The case studies were another turning point. They were not about getting the “right answer” immediately. They demanded patience, reasoning, and the ability to sit with uncertainty. I struggled, but I also learned how to think instead of just follow steps. Completing them within the given timeline gave me confidence — not because they were perfect, but because I finished something I once doubted I could.</p>

<p>What stayed with me throughout this journey was the emphasis on <strong>consistency</strong>. Attendance, regular submissions, discussions, and feedback — none of these felt optional. Slowly, I began to understand why. Learning here was not treated as an event, but as a habit.</p>

<p>Now, as I continue this internship, I feel different from how I started. I am more focused, more serious, and more aware of how I learn. I no longer rush through content just to complete it. I value understanding over speed.</p>

<p>I am grateful to all the professors, mentors, and peers who guided me continuously and created an environment where learning felt challenging but supportive. I truly hope to complete this internship on a positive note and carry these lessons beyond these weeks.</p>

<p>This journey did not just teach me tools or technologies.<br />
It taught me patience, confidence, and trust in my own pace of growth.</p>

        <h1 id="my-learning-journey-so-far">My Learning Journey So Far</h1>
<p>I joined this internship believing that my biggest challenge would be technical learning. I assumed the difficult part would be understanding concepts, keeping up with the pace, or finishing assignments on time. What I didn’t expect was that my real struggle would be something much quieter — confidence, especially when it came to speaking.</p>

<p>In the beginning, I found myself holding back. During discussions or breakout rooms, I often knew what I wanted to say, but hesitation took over. I would overthink my words, worry about being wrong, or feel that others might express the idea better than me. So I stayed silent. Not because I wasn’t interested, but because confidence doesn’t always arrive when it’s needed.</p>

<p>This internship didn’t force me to speak. Instead, it created an environment where showing up consistently mattered more than performing perfectly. Daily stand-up sessions, regular learning on the ViBe platform, and continuous engagement slowly built a rhythm in my days. Without realizing it, discipline started forming first — waking up on time, attending sessions regularly, completing what I started.</p>

<p>And somewhere inside that discipline, confidence began to grow.</p>

<p>I noticed that when I stayed consistent, fear slowly lost its grip. Listening to others, observing how discussions unfolded, and being present every day made things feel less intimidating. Speaking didn’t feel like a test anymore. It started feeling like participation. Even when I didn’t speak, I was no longer anxious — I was learning how to be comfortable in the space.</p>

<p>What this internship taught me is that confidence doesn’t always come from bold actions. Sometimes, it comes from small habits done repeatedly. Discipline created stability, and stability made confidence possible.</p>

<p>Most virtual internships today come with minimal interaction. Tasks are assigned, deadlines are fixed and learning often feels solitary. I entered this internship with similar expectations, assuming it would follow the same pattern with IIT-level rigor and timely requirements to be met. I was nervous yet excited to handle the pressure and complex tasks, but not confident enough in my ability to meet those expectations. What unfolded instead was an unexpected shift. The experience became a learning journey where interaction, encouragement and shared growth took center stage, making this internship far more meaningful than I had imagined.</p>

<p>I didn’t expect a virtual internship to feel this alive. Unlike typical online programs with minimal interaction, each day here began with meaningful morning stand-ups where the professor’s presence, motivation and stories made the space feel human and grounding. Those moments reminded us that learning is a process, not a race. When case studies felt overwhelming and self-doubt crept in, we were encouraged to stay patient and focus on building strong foundations layer by layer. Regular quizzes and brainstorming sessions pushed us to think, reflect and engage actively and though intense at times, the experience clearly reflected growth through presence and commitment.</p>

<p>One session that left a lasting impact was when sir spoke about the <strong>Power of Weak Ties</strong> and asked us to explore it ourselves and apply it in real life. It wasn’t just theory; it was an invitation to think beyond code, beyond screens and beyond the internship itself. In that moment, I realized this experience was shaping how we think, not just what we learn. The idea wasn’t something to memorize, but something to live by.</p>

<p>During our daily stand-up sessions, we often heard discussions about how the government is actively supporting initiatives such as NPTEL programs and internship opportunities that allow students to work closely with IITs. Learning about these efforts made me appreciate how intentionally such opportunities are being created to bridge academia and real-world impact. Alongside this, being introduced to initiatives like <strong>ANNAM.AI</strong>, which focus on applying artificial intelligence to the agricultural sector, genuinely caught my interest. It highlighted how technology, when backed by thoughtful policy and purpose, can be directed toward solving real societal challenges in areas such as farming, sustainability and food security, rather than remaining limited to theory or hype.</p>

<p>Another beautiful aspect was how learning became collective. New interactions turned into shared growth. We explained concepts to each other, discussed doubts and supported one another. I learned that when you share knowledge, it doesn’t diminish; it expands. Simply sharing my opinions and understanding, not formally teaching, helped me realize that I was building the confidence to guide and explain concepts to others.</p>

<p>Over time, this culture of positivity, encouragement and collaboration transformed the experience. The biggest takeaway wasn’t a specific technology or tool. It was <strong>confidence</strong>. Confidence to ask questions, to stay patient with learning, to trust the process and to keep going even when things feel unclear. This internship reminded me that progress isn’t always loud or instant; sometimes, it’s built quietly through daily motivation, supportive leadership and people learning together. This internship taught me lessons far beyond code—about encouragement as a skill, learning as a journey and growth as something that happens best together.</p>

        # My Internship Journey: Transforming Procrastination Into Progress


This internship has been a highly rewarding experience that supported my growth on personal, academic, and professional levels. Beyond strengthening my technical skills, it helped me develop a structured mindset and adopt a more disciplined and professional approach to learning and work.

At the beginning of the internship, my exposure to Express.js and React was limited, and these technologies initially felt challenging. However, the focused, bite-sized learning format provided through the ViBe platform made the journey engaging and manageable. The concise modules encouraged daily learning, improved consistency, and enabled me to successfully complete 100% of my ViBe learning progress with confidence. Instant feedback, visible progress, and small milestones created a healthy dopamine-driven motivation, making learning feel rewarding and achievable rather than overwhelming.

A significant part of my learning experience involved collaborative learning with peers. Through breakout rooms, I gained hands-on exposure to TypeScript and MongoDB, where peer discussions, shared problem-solving, and mutual support helped deepen my understanding of these technologies. These interactive sessions promoted active participation, knowledge exchange, and practical learning beyond individual study.

One of the most meaningful transformations during this journey was overcoming procrastination and significantly reducing doom scrolling. Real-time progress tracking and rank updates helped me stay focused and replace unproductive habits with intentional learning. Daily stand-ups and interactive Zoom sessions further enriched the experience by encouraging discussions, idea exchange, and learning from diverse perspectives.

Overall, this internship helped me shift from outcome-driven pressure to curiosity-driven, consistent learning. It reinforced the importance of focus, attention to detail, collaboration, and continuous improvement. I am excited to apply my learning to real-world projects and continue growing through hands-on development.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to VLEAD (Vicharanashala Lab), Annam.ai, and IIT Ropar for providing this valuable internship opportunity, continuous guidance, and a well-structured learning environment that made this journey impactful and enriching. give in readme.md format

        <h1 id="the-internship-that-changed-my-perspective-on-online-learning">The Internship That Changed My Perspective on Online Learning</h1>

<p>Hello everyone, I would like to share my experience of doing the Winter Internship at IIT Ropar, an experience that truly changed the way I look at online learning.</p>

<p>When I first heard about this opportunity, it was mentioned that only students with Top 5% / Elite + Gold certifications in NPTEL courses were eligible to apply. Even though I did not fully meet these criteria, I decided to apply with a small hope. I believed that even impossible opportunities deserve an honest attempt. Later, we were informed that due to the large number of applications, candidates would be shortlisted and selected by the professors.</p>

<p>When we were asked to submit a No Objection Certificate from our college, I realized that many students from my college had also applied. Despite all the doubts and uncertainty, one fine day we received the offer letter, which was both shocking and exciting. Nearly 400 students across India were selected for this internship.</p>

<p>The internship began on 22nd December at 9:00 AM, with full-day Zoom sessions. Initially, I assumed it would be a typical online internship involving lectures, assignments, and a final certificate. However, the very first lecture by Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar Sir completely changed my expectations. His session was deeply motivating and made us eagerly look forward to the daily 9 AM stand-up meetings.</p>

<p>As the days passed, these stand-up sessions became one of the most valuable parts of the internship.</p>

<p>Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar Sir’s stand-ups provided constant motivation and clarity of thought.
Meenakshi Ma’am’s interactions encouraged students to openly share experiences and reflect on their learning journey.
Sakshi Ma’am’s Health Points strategies introduced a unique and engaging way to maintain consistency and discipline throughout the internship.</p>

<p>This internship helped me realize that online learning can be even more effective than offline learning when designed properly. We were trained on the MERN stack using the ViBe platform, where cameras had to be on, lectures were short and focused, and quizzes followed every video. Even a single wrong answer required revisiting the video, ensuring that learning could not be skipped.</p>

<p>Along with the courses, we were given case studies that required applying the learned concepts practically.</p>

<p>Even though only two weeks of the internship have been completed, I have already gained valuable technical knowledge, improved focus, and developed better learning discipline.</p>

<p>This experience taught me that the problem is not online learning—it is how we engage with it.</p>

<h1 id="my-nptel-winter-internship-experience">My NPTEL WINTER INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE</h1>

<h2 id="chilakamarri-krishna-panchajanya">Chilakamarri Krishna Panchajanya</h2>

<p>When I was in my III BTech II Semester, one of my professors named Abdul S Kani suggested me and my friends to write the NPTEL Examination. At first, we were reluctant and thought about the 1000₹ we needed to spend and the amount of work I had to do to finish the weekly assignments and listen to NPTEL classes along with my college work.</p>

<p>But one fine day, we decided to go for it and applied for the NPTEL Programming in Java exam. To be honest, I did not listen to classes daily. I used to listen to classes every Sunday all at once and submit the assignment on the same day.</p>

<p>At last, the day arrived to give the NPTEL Java exam. My five other friends and I prepared so much for the exam, and after coming out of the exam hall, our faces were filled with happiness and pride that we could do the NPTEL exam well. When the results arrived, I was shocked and happy at the same time. I got 95% in Java and was in the Topper 5% and Elite + Gold category. My five other friends were also in the Elite + Gold category.</p>

<p>The same professor suggested us to apply for the NPTEL Winter Internship, which I had not heard of until that day. We applied for the internship under the guidance of Professor Sudarshan Iyengar and had little to no hope that I would get selected. But one fine day, I got an email that I was selected for the internship.</p>

<h1 id="my-experience-during-internship">My Experience during Internship</h1>

<p>The internship started on 22 December 2025 at 9:00 AM in the morning. I had no clue about what would happen, what to do, or what to learn to keep up the pace during the internship. But the very first Zoom meeting gave me enough confidence that I could manage to sail through the internship if I put in adequate effort.</p>

<p>I would wake up early in the morning every day, eagerly waiting for the Zoom meeting to start and listening to the motivation provided by Sudarshan Iyengar sir and Meenakshi ma’am. Until that very first Zoom meeting, I had no idea that Zoom had so many features.</p>

<p>During each meeting, I carefully and curiously listened to each and every word of Sudarshan sir. I learned many things during this internship. One of them was realizing that I can eat two chapathis within 3 minutes by turning off the video and carefully listening to the meeting, while being afraid that Sudarshan sir might ask why my video was off.</p>

<p>I was very eager and enthusiastic to speak every day in the meeting, and I wanted to be known to Sudarshan sir in a good way (not in a bad way).</p>

<p>Many great ideas were implemented by all the team members of the internship to ensure maximum attendance and maximum learning.</p>

<p>To be honest, until Sakshi Sharma ma’am showed us the capabilities of Google Sheets, I used to think of Google Sheets as a piece of trash.</p>

<h1 id="things-i-got-to-know-during-the-internship">Things I Got to Know during the Internship</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Zoom features</li>
  <li>Google Sheets features</li>
  <li>How to effectively use LinkedIn (which I used more in these ten days than I did in my four years of BTech)</li>
  <li>How to consistently learn the MERN stack and complete 100% progress in three days</li>
  <li>About Zoho Cliq</li>
  <li>Attendance automation</li>
</ul>

<p>After every session, my motivation reached a peak until I started feeling hungry, closed the laptop, and went to eat. But when I started doing the case studies, especially during React, my frustration also reached a peak, and at one point I wanted to throw away my laptop. Then I remembered that ChatGPT could save my laptop from being thrown away by explaining the case studies to me.</p>

<p>Honestly, for some case studies, I asked ChatGPT to explain them to me as if it were explaining to a donkey. It simplified everything as much as possible.</p>

<p>I have now finished my case studies, and my heart feels lighter, as if a heavy stone has been removed from my head. Now I am excited to work on a real-time project.</p>

<p>When I wanted to talk during Zoom sessions, a few things stopped me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sometimes the microphone felt like it was possessed by a devil</li>
  <li>Sometimes my fear stopped me from talking</li>
  <li>Another fear was health points deduction</li>
</ul>

<p>But most of the time, I spoke with Sudarshan sir, and I believe that he at least knows my name when he sees the participants list. I truly hope that I give my best for the project and make everyone remember me.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,
Chilakamarri Krishna Panchajanya</p>

      <span>MY FIRST INTERNSHIP JOURNEY - DANIEL RAJ.S (WIN25628)</span>
    </summary>
    
    <div style="padding: 1.5rem; background-color: white;">
      <div style="prose max-width: none; text-align: justify;">
        <p>This is my first internship, and it is also a virtual one. But more than that, it is an experience that completely reshaped my understanding of what an internship should truly be.
Many internships today feel more like short-term classes. A teacher explains concepts, gives a few examples, and at the end, a certificate is handed over. Learning happens, but the real industry exposure often feels missing.
This internship was different.
I am Daniel Raj, an intern at IIT Ropar, and here, learning begins with self-discipline, curiosity, and responsibility.</p>

<h2 id="learning-driven-by-us-not-pressure">Learning Driven by Us, Not Pressure</h2>
<p>No one here forces us to work late at night. There are no messages demanding work at 10 PM or 11 PM. Instead, we push ourselves—to complete one more case study, to finish one more section, to understand one more concept deeply.
The team provides direction and tasks.
The real learning starts when we decide how far we want to go.
That is where this internship stands apart.</p>

<h2 id="week-one-a-powerful-first-impression">Week One: A Powerful First Impression</h2>
<p>The very first day itself was inspiring.
The meeting was scheduled at 9:00 AM, but by 8:55 AM, more than 350 participants were already waiting. Many of them were among the top NPTEL performers in India, part of the top 500 learners. Seeing such dedication on day one motivated me instantly.</p>

<h2 id="vibe-a-new-way-to-learn">VIBE: A New Way to Learn</h2>
<p>We were introduced to the VIBE learning platform, and it truly felt like a game changer.
Today’s generation is naturally drawn to short-form content like Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. The creators of VIBE turned this habit into a powerful learning tool by designing a platform based on short, focused learning videos.
====================
What makes it unique:
====================
Each concept is taught through short videos
Every video is followed by a quiz
You cannot move forward unless you understand the concept
In the first two days, I completed only 17% of the course. But over the next three days, everything changed. I found myself learning until 12 AM, watching videos, attempting quizzes, rewatching concepts, and ensuring I truly understood them.
This was not passive learning.
This was learning with clarity.</p>

<h2 id="learning-together">Learning Together</h2>
<p>Another beautiful part of this internship is the people.
My co-interns are incredibly supportive. Each one is not just a learner, but also a teacher and a friend. The environment is humble, respectful, and motivating. Learning together made the journey even more meaningful.</p>

<h2 id="week-two-turning-knowledge-into-practice">Week Two: Turning Knowledge into Practice</h2>
<p>The second week marked a transition—from learning concepts to implementing them through problem-solving and case studies.
This phase is crucial. Before entering any project phase, applying what we learn builds confidence and real understanding. The structure of the internship made this transition smooth and effective.</p>

<h2 id="learning-over-copying">Learning Over Copying</h2>
<p>When the case study submission rules were introduced, they encouraged something very important—learning instead of copying.
Rather than using ChatGPT for copy-paste answers, we were guided to understand, apply, and explain concepts in our own way. This approach genuinely helped us upskill and grow.
Full credit goes to Prof. Sudharshan Sir and his entire team for designing such a thoughtful learning structure.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-beyond-code">Lessons Beyond Code</h2>
<p>Sudharshan Sir is not only an excellent mentor in technology but also in life. His guidance on careers, decision-making, and personal growth added depth to this experience.
On 25/12/2025, he invited us to a Christmas meet where he spoke about life, happiness, and careers. That session left a lasting impression on me.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-deeply-grateful-to">I am deeply grateful to:</h2>
<p>**Meenakshi Ma’am
**Nithin Sir
**Nandhan Sir
**Bhavana Ma’am
**Harshdeep Ma’am
**Sakshi Ma’am</p>

<h2 id="gratitude">Gratitude</h2>
<p>This internship taught me more than technical skills.
It taught me how to learn, how to think, and how to grow.
I am truly thankful for this journey.</p>

<p>When I first received the opportunity to intern with the team at <strong>IIT Ropar</strong>, I felt genuinely overwhelmed. Working under the guidance of Sudarshan sir and the VLED team was something I had never expected. I did not imagine that this internship would turn out to be so informative, engaging, and filled with learning at every step.</p>

<p>What truly made this experience special was the way learning was integrated into everything we did. Every morning stand-up call felt refreshing and exciting. The mentors always had something new planned for us be it interactive quizzes designed in impressive ways, thought-provoking topics to brainstorm, or insightful discussions that stayed with me even after the sessions ended. It genuinely felt like fun blended with learning.</p>

<p>The breakout sessions played a major role in shaping my experience. They encouraged learning through peers and helped me step out of my comfort zone. <strong>Expressing ideas, listening to different perspectives, and actively participating in discussions made the learning process more meaningful</strong>. Brainstorming together, solving queries, and discussing ideas with people from different backgrounds prepared us well to take on real project work with confidence.</p>

<p>Another aspect I deeply appreciated was the <strong>structured learning approach</strong> first understanding concepts thoroughly and then implementing them through case studies and discussions. The <strong>focus was always on depth of learning rather than just meeting deadlines</strong>. Here, learning mattered more than just completing tasks.</p>

<p>The ViBe platform also contributed significantly to my focus and discipline. It eliminated distractions and ensured that learning was taken seriously. If attention dropped, the video would reset, reinforcing the importance of understanding concepts thoroughly. <strong>Learning with the support of AI truly felt like the future of education</strong>, and the platform handled it exceptionally well.</p>

<p>The mentors were incredibly supportive and proactive. They resolved queries quickly and continuously introduced new activities to keep our minds engaged. Their dedication and quick responses made the learning environment dynamic and motivating.</p>

<p>This internship also helped me <strong>grow professionally</strong> in unexpected ways. My <strong>LinkedIn</strong> profile gained attention, and I was able to build meaningful connections through this opportunity.</p>

<p>One lesson that stayed with me throughout the internship was <strong>Sudarshan sir’s constant emphasis on focusing on learning rather than running behind deadlines</strong>. That mindset changed how I approach work and learning. Every day, I woke up thinking about what new thing I would learn next.</p>

<p>The encouragement through <strong>health points</strong> motivated me to give my best effort consistently. In just a few weeks, this internship pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me move toward genuine professional growth.</p>

<p>In just 2 weeks at this internship I have realised that this experience was not about finishing fast , it was about learning deeply.<br />
And that made all the difference.</p>

        <p>When I first stepped into this internship, confusion was the strongest feeling I carried with me.</p>

<p>Being part of an internship associated with such a reputed institution came with excitement, but also quiet uncertainty. I kept wondering whether I would be able to keep up with what lay ahead. It wasn’t fear of failure; it was the unfamiliarity of stepping into something new and unknown.</p>

<p>As the journey began to unfold, that uncertainty slowly gave way to experience.</p>

<p>The morning standups became a turning point in my routine. They were more than just daily check-ins—they were gentle reminders of discipline, accountability, and the boundaries of a professional learning space. Each standup felt like a small reset, pushing me to show up with intention and reminding me that there was still so much left to explore and learn.</p>

<p>As the days progressed, I realized this internship was shaping me in ways I hadn’t expected. It wasn’t just about acquiring technical skills. It ignited a deeper passion to learn—not for the sake of completing a 9-to-6 schedule, but to grow as an individual. I started focusing less on finishing tasks and more on understanding concepts, questioning assumptions, and learning with purpose.</p>

<p>One of the most meaningful shifts happened in how I viewed consistency and self-expression. Earlier, I avoided sharing my journey on platforms like LinkedIn,not because I lacked experiences, but because I felt I wasn’t doing enough. Through this internship, I learned that growth doesn’t need to wait for perfection. Sharing your learning, no matter the stage, is part of the process.</p>

<p>This internship also introduced me to people I might never have connected with otherwise. Learning alongside others, seeing different approaches, and growing together added depth to the experience. The environment was motivating without being pressuring, encouraging steady improvement rather than comparison.</p>

<p>Looking back, the biggest lesson I take with me is the power of consistency, hard work, and openness to learning. With guided purpose and focused effort, growth becomes inevitable.</p>

<p>This journey didn’t just teach me what to learn, it taught me how to approach learning with patience, awareness, and trust in the process. And that is something I will carry forward long after this internship ends.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the entire mentor team for creating a learning space that encouraged growth, reflection, and meaningful engagement throughout this journey 💗.</p>

<p>“Growth happens quietly, when you stop asking when and start trusting how.”</p>

      <span>From Nervous Beginnings to Growing Confidence: My Winter Internship Journey at IIT Ropar - Dnyanesh Agale (WIN25513)</span>

      <div style="prose max-width: none; text-align: justify;">
        <p>When this internship started, I was honestly nervous.</p>

<p>Not because I was afraid of working hard, but because I wasn’t sure what to expect from myself in a new learning environment. Four weeks felt short, yet meaningful. I wondered how I would manage the pace, the expectations, and the learning style. What I didn’t expect was how quickly that nervousness would turn into excitement—and how much this experience would change the way I think.</p>

<p>This internship never felt like a typical program where you just complete tasks and move on. From the beginning, learning was very hands-on. Working with the MERN stack was not only about building applications, but about understanding how things actually work and why certain decisions matter. There were moments when things didn’t work as expected, but those moments taught me more than smooth successes ever could.</p>

<p>One of the best parts of this journey for me was the daily routine. The early morning stand-up calls helped build discipline and focus. They gave structure to the day and pushed me to stay consistent. The breakout room sessions were even more valuable. Learning alongside my co-interns, solving problems together, and practicing hands-on made the experience much richer. Explaining ideas, listening to others, and fixing mistakes together created a strong sense of learning as a team.</p>

<p>As the internship moved forward, I noticed a change in myself.</p>

<p>The nervousness I felt at the beginning slowly turned into confidence. Not overnight, but step by step. Case studies challenged my thinking, projects pushed me to apply what I had learned, and feedback helped me understand where I could improve. Each small effort added up, and over time, I felt more comfortable taking responsibility for my learning.</p>

<p>What stayed with me the most is not just the technical knowledge, but the mindset I developed during this internship. The focus on consistency, regular practice, and learning through experience changed how I approach problems. Even though this internship lasted only a month, its impact on me feels much bigger. The lessons I learned here will stay with me for a long time.</p>

<p>I am truly grateful for the guidance, structure, and learning environment provided during this Winter Internship at IIT Ropar under the NPTEL programme :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. This journey has made me more confident, more aware of my learning process, and excited for what lies ahead.</p>

<h2 id="a-nervous-start">A Nervous Start</h2>
<p>On the first day of my first internship, the schedule was from 9 AM to 6 PM continuously, with only a few short breaks. I was honestly scared after seeing the timings. But as the days passed, I realized that instead of losing time, I was actually finding myself. I finally understood where I was standing, what I was lacking, and how I could improve.</p>

<h2 id="learning-by-doing">Learning by Doing</h2>
<p>Learning here does not stop with watching videos. After completing the modules, we move into hands-on case studies, where real thinking and problem-solving begin. This was the first time I experienced learning that truly challenged me, and it made me feel like I was slowly becoming a real developer, not just a student. At that moment, I realized this was not going to be just an internship.</p>

<h2 id="morning-mentorship">Morning Mentorship</h2>
<p>Every day at 9 AM during the stand-up sessions, I see our teachers — Professor Sudarshan Iyengar Sir, Meenakshi Ma’am, Sakshi Ma’am, Bhavna Ma’am, Harshadeep Ma’am, Jinal Gupta Ma’am, and Nitin Shankar Sir — bringing such positive energy. The way Meenakshi Ma’am starts the day with a smile fills me with the same positivity. The session by Sudarshan Sir always boosts motivation, gives good direction, and reminds me why I chose this field. The fellow interns make each session more interesting and lively. The way Nandhan Sir explained the ViBe course, along with the extra sessions he takes, helped us learn beyond expectations. The session by Sakshi Ma’am was especially interesting because it taught us much more than just MERN.</p>

<h2 id="two-week-change">Two-Week Change</h2>
<p>We have completed only two weeks of the internship, and in this short time I have learned so much. Life before the internship and life after the internship are not the same. Every single day gives me a new chance to change, to grow, and to become better. I stopped doom scrolling, I started waking up early so I would never miss the 9 AM stand-up, and I now try to improve myself a little more every day. These small habits make me proud, especially because this is my very first internship.</p>

<h2 id="deep-learning">Deep Learning</h2>
<p>Sudarshan Sir and the entire team continuously introduce new activities that make learning enjoyable and meaningful. They conduct live polls during Zoom sessions, quizzes, interactive discussions, and special learning sessions. Discussing in breakout rooms with peers and solving case studies together made learning even more engaging and practical. This internship values depth over speed, and that completely changed the way I approach learning.</p>

<h2 id="a-dream-fulfilled-and-gratitude">A Dream Fulfilled and Gratitude</h2>
<p>Overall, this experience has been truly life-changing. It transformed the way I think, study, and focus. Studying in an IIT has always been a dream for me, and in this form, through this internship, I feel that dream has been fulfilled. As my first internship, this journey will always remain special to me. Above all, I feel deep gratitude and thankfulness toward all the teachers who work so hard for our growth, not just as developers, but as individuals.</p>

        <p>“FROM ENDURING TO EXPERIENCING”:</p>

<p>My internship began on December 2025, and to be honest, I had no clear idea what to expect. This was my first-ever internship, and that too in virtual mode. I stepped in with curiosity, nervousness, and a lot of uncertainty.
The first week was focused on completing a course on the “VIBE platform”. At that stage, my mindset was simple: finish everything before the deadline. I was more concerned about ticking tasks off the list than actually understanding what I was learning. Looking back, I realise this is how many of us begin focused on completion rather than comprehension.
But something slowly started to CHANGE.
As days passed, I began to enjoy the internship. Learning STOPPED feeling like a burden and started feeling meaningful. I began to communicate with my peers, observe discussions, and participate even if silently at first. That shift made a huge difference.</p>

<p>“ONE HONEST TRUTH ABOUT ME”:</p>

<p>I struggled badly with confidence and communication. Seeing others speak freely and confidently was intimidating. At times, I felt left out, almost INVISIBLE. Whenever there was a chance to talk, my mind would panic for no reason at all.
Instead of giving up, I CHOSE to observe.
I watched how my peers expressed their ideas, how they communicated naturally, and how comfortable they were in conversations. Surprisingly, this observation became one of my biggest learning tools. I admired their communication skills and slowly started learning from them not through textbooks, but through real interactions.
At some point, I realised something important:
Instead of just enduring the experience, I had started experiencing it.
That small mindset shift changed everything. The fear didn’t disappear overnight, but it became manageable. I was no longer just surviving the internship I was GROWING through it.</p>

<p>“GRATEFULL FOR VALUABLE OPPORTUNITY”:</p>

<p>I’m genuinely grateful to NPTEL for providing such a valuable opportunity,And to Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar and the team for creating this environment, and to my peers who unknowingly became my teachers. This internship didn’t just teach me technical concepts  it taught me CONFIDENCE,OBSERVATION, and the COURAGE to grow.
This journey reminded me that learning doesn’t always begin with understanding. Sometimes, it begins with simply showing up — and staying.</p>

      <div style="prose max-width: none; text-align: justify;">
        <p>When I joined this internship, I believed learning the MERN stack would be the most challenging part.</p>

<p>What I didn’t expect was that the real challenge would be consistency — showing up every day with focus, even when no one was pushing me.</p>

<p>This internship, conducted through the NPTEL Winter internship program at IIT Ropar, introduced me to a learning structure that focused on depth, consistency, and reflection rather than speed.</p>

<p>The ViBe platform changed how I approached learning. Short videos, attention checks, and quizzes after every concept made rushing impossible. At first, it felt restrictive. Over time, it taught me something valuable: learning deeply matters more than finishing quickly.</p>

<p>Case studies were another turning point. They didn’t reward instant answers. Instead, they required patience, reasoning, and the ability to sit with confusion. There were moments when I felt stuck, but completing each case study gave me confidence — not because my solutions were perfect, but because I learned how to think through problems.</p>

<p>Daily stand-up sessions quietly brought discipline into my routine. Waking up on time, attending consistently, and listening to others share their experiences made learning feel structured and purposeful. No one forced this discipline — it developed naturally.</p>

<p>Some of the most meaningful learning came from conversations. Breakout room discussions and listening to peers helped me realize that everyone struggles in their own way. That understanding made the learning space feel open and supportive.</p>

<p>This internship didn’t just teach me technical concepts.<br />
It taught me to slow down, stay consistent, and trust gradual progress.</p>

<p>I’m grateful to the VLED Lab and NPTEL for creating an environment where learning feels intentional, human, and meaningful. This experience changed not just what I learn — but how I learn.</p>

        <p>DISCLAIMER: This blog might be long, but it is from my heart.</p>

<p>I precisely remember it to be the 15th of October,2025, and we were waiting with anticipation for NPTEL to publish the list of candidates who had been shortlisted for that year’s winter Internship. As the anticipation kept growing so did my curiousity to know what am i supposed to be pre-equipped with incase I get shortlisted.So it was on that this day that I mustered up some courage and dropped a message to Sudarshan sir on LinkedIn as follows:</p>

<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1WNeiehz25QE7ZGrzPMKP1iktOvrfwwDu" alt="LinkedIn Message" /></p>

<p>As expected, I knew it for certain that an IIT Professor would surely be a pretty busy person and hence I just waited for the Internship to begin and to go with the flow.</p>

<p><em>Learning on the fly, The Deer effect, Grit and Perseverance over passion.</em><br />
<em>In fact I maintained a diary to take note of important technical things in the Internship but then ended up the first two pages only with the enormously fantastic ideas that were popped up in our stand-up sessions:</em></p>

<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1IvyioG0GyJws3hRAf1RmpdbVtlvCfiG7" alt="Diary Notes - Page 1" /></p>

<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1gcbeGiMZMJGiSUCZHsEus36GXO2gA12D" alt="Diary Notes - Page 2" /></p>

<p>By the end of the first day, I made up my mind and also told my parents that I would want to skip my semester end examinations , take up this Internship seriously have backlogs, get a year back and go and clear them next year ! (but thankfully that didn’t happen and things somehow just worked out !)</p>

<p>One of our projects, which in turn was our learning platform too, called ViBe (named after the legendary story of Vikram Bethal) turned out to be very interesting and fun at the start but as and when I proceeded it got frustrating at times, I would shamelessly watch a lecture at least 7-8 times and still make a mistake in the quiz and go back, but looking at the other side of the coin, it is this very platform that helped me over come my doom – scrolling. I with utmost honestly confess that I used to Doom Scroll to the extent that I would be left thinking, <em>am I using the phone or is the phone using me?.</em> I don’t know what algorithm or magical mantra this platform has used , but I know longer get that urge to scroll.</p>

<p>Solving of case studies I must say, was one really important factor that built my grit and thought me how to keep things going even when they seem to be tough !, we were a group of around 4-5 people Karthik bhaiya, Krishna didi, Shruti didi, Inchara akka and we would solve the case studies together, many a times when we would get stuck and then we decide to hit the basics from scratch again. From Reading documentations to watching youtube tutorials and what not. I still remember one unforgettable incident where we were watching a youtube lecture on the introduction to React and the lecturer saying “<em>React kya hai ?… Kuch bhi nahi hai</em>”, that got us laughing a lot .</p>

<p>Helping my peers and most importantly helping just for the sake of helping and no other hidden motive was something that truly helped me out learn concepts much faster, It kind of gave me a catalyst effect. Indeed true is the quote that states “<em>I helped a man climb a mountain and found that I too had reached the top</em> !”</p>

<p>My humble pranaams to Sudarshan sir and his revered team , Meenakshi mam, Nitin sir, Jinal mam, Harshdeep mam, Nandan sir ,Bhavana mam and all the other unsung heroes behind the scenes for helping me realise that with perseverance, Grit and an iron will, literally anything could be achieved, literally anything…<br />
It is truly then when <strong><em>sky is no more our limit, its our base !</em></strong></p>

        <h2 id="my-internship-journey-from-uncertainty-to-confidence-in-learning-mern">My Internship Journey: From Uncertainty to Confidence in Learning MERN</h2>

<p>When I began this internship, I was completely focused on learning Java full-stack development, and transitioning to the MERN stack initially felt challenging. The tools, concepts, and development approach were different from what I was used to, which made me feel uncertain about my abilities. I did not have complete confidence or clarity about my skills in MERN. What I did have, however, was curiosity and a strong willingness to learn. At the start, I was unsure about what to expect or whether I would be able to keep up, but as the days progressed, the learning journey helped me gradually find my footing.</p>

<p>The learning approach felt unfamiliar at first. Instead of long and overwhelming sessions, the content was delivered in short, focused modules on the ViBe learning platform. This structure helped me stay attentive and prevented burnout. After each video, there was a quiz, and completing these quizzes gave me a small yet meaningful sense of achievement. This steady rhythm kept me motivated—it felt less like passively consuming content and more like actively participating in the learning process.</p>

<p>As the internship progressed, learning moved beyond videos into hands-on case studies. These case studies were thoughtfully designed to bridge the gap between theory and real-world application. They introduced practical scenarios across modern web development technologies, requiring deeper thinking and problem-solving. Working on them helped me understand how different concepts connect and function together in real situations.</p>

<h3 id="what-the-case-studies-helped-me-with">What the Case Studies Helped Me With</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Apply concepts instead of merely recalling them</li>
  <li>Connect ideas in a logical and structured way</li>
  <li>Strengthen my problem-solving and analytical thinking</li>
</ul>

<p>Another important part of this internship experience was the daily stand-up sessions. I made it a habit to attend these sessions every day at sharp 9:00 AM, turning on my video—not because it was mandatory, but out of genuine interest and excitement to be part of the discussion. These sessions created a sense of discipline, connection, and motivation to stay consistent in my learning.</p>

<p>Professor Sudarshan Iyengar Sir played a key role in shaping the overall learning experience through his guidance and vision. Along with him, Meenakshi Ma’am, Sakshi Ma’am, Bhavna Ma’am, Harshadeep Ma’am, Jinal Gupta Ma’am, and Nitin Sankar Sir contributed significantly to making the sessions engaging and interactive. They frequently conducted live polls, quizzes, and interactive activities during Zoom sessions and also introduced us to concepts beyond the regular curriculum. These interactions made the learning environment lively and encouraged active participation.</p>

<p>A special mention goes to Nandan Prabhudesai Sir, who taught us the MERN stack through the ViBe platform. His sessions helped me clearly understand core MERN concepts and how different parts of the stack work together. The GitHub and React sessions conducted by him were especially helpful in building practical understanding and confidence. Because of his teaching approach, learning MERN felt structured, approachable, and meaningful.</p>

<p>One moment that particularly stood out during a Zoom session was when Sakshi Ma’am explained how our internship progress is automated using scripts that directly update data in Google Sheets. The explanation was simple yet impactful. It clearly demonstrated how programming can be used to automate everyday processes and how even small ideas can create meaningful and practical solutions.</p>

<p>The breakout room discussions added another valuable layer to my learning experience. Collaborating with peers while solving case studies exposed me to multiple perspectives. Listening to others explain their thought processes often helped me gain better clarity on concepts and identify gaps in my own understanding.</p>

<h3 id="key-takeaways-from-discussions">Key Takeaways from Discussions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Learning becomes stronger when shared</li>
  <li>Different viewpoints deepen understanding</li>
  <li>Collaboration builds confidence and clarity</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, this internship taught me that learning does not happen all at once. It is a gradual process built through consistent engagement, practical application, discussion, and reflection. While I am still learning, I now approach new concepts with far more confidence and curiosity than when I first started. This journey has not only strengthened my technical skills but has also reshaped the way I view learning itself.</p>

      <div style="prose max-width: none; text-align: justify;">
        <p>I never thought that writing an NPTEL exam would bring me this far - to becoming an intern at IIT Ropar, under the guidance of Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar sir. At the time, it was just an exam. I didn’t imagine it would open the door to a journey that would change how I think about learning, life, and myself.</p>

<p>When the internship began, I again had no big expectations. But very soon, I realized this was not going to be a routine internship. It turned into a journey where I genuinely enjoyed each and every day.</p>

<p>The mornings always started with stand-up meetings, and they never felt like pressure. Instead, they felt like a boost - something that brought energy and joy. The games, quizzes, and small interactions made the start of the day positive and refreshing.</p>

<p>What truly stood out to me were Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar sir’s thoughts. He never just spoke about subjects or technology. He spoke about life - ideas like the strength of weak ties, student mindset, placements, and careers. His words gave me a completely different perspective. He didn’t teach us what to think; he changed how we think.</p>

<p>After the stand-ups, the ViBe course felt less like a task and more like a game. Learning the MERN stack through videos and quizzes was something I actually looked forward to. Instead of chasing deadlines, the quizzes at the end of each video gave me confidence. Studying in an environment like ViBe made learning enjoyable, calm, and meaningful.</p>

<p>The evening daily activities added another layer of excitement. Every day, I was curious about what was coming next. The internship never felt repetitive - it always felt new, like a ray of hope pushing me forward.</p>

<p>After the first week, we moved into case studies, and that phase gave me a solid and deeper understanding of MERN. Solving case studies with peers in breakout rooms made learning easier and more fun. We weren’t just solving problems. We were understanding real-world scenarios and thinking about solutions that actually make sense.</p>

<p>There’s a saying: it takes two hands clapping to make a sound. That’s exactly how the case studies felt. Working together made everything clearer and more enjoyable.</p>

<p>I also attended this journey with two of my college friends, Bhavan K and Balasurya G. Each day gave us something to discuss, reflect on, and learn from together. Along the way, I connected with new people like Siva Balan and JAISREE RAGAVI J, and many more during breakout rooms. Everyone brought their own perspective, and learning truly became a group activity.</p>

<p>Every single day felt special. It was never just another routine day.</p>

<p>Now, I’m eager to move into the project phase, where I hope to work on projects that solve real-world problems.</p>

<p>This journey wouldn’t have been this smooth without the amazing team behind it. Meenakshi V ma’am’s morning enthusiasm and smile always brightened the stand-ups. Sakshi Sharma ma’am’s health points idea, dashboard and games added fun and motivation. Jinal Gupta mam, Harshdeep Rana mam, and Bhavana Yedla mam were always kind and supportive. Nitin Sankar sir’s support and guiding words, Rohit Sharma sir’s project ideas, and Nandan Prabhudesai sir’s teaching, especially in ViBe and live sessions played a huge role in shaping this experience.</p>

<p>I’m deeply thankful to all of them for their guidance, support, and friendliness.</p>

<p>This journey is not just an internship for me. It gave me life lessons, confidence, and a ray of hope to step forward.</p>

<p>I’ll end with a quote that now feels very real to me:</p>

<p>“Life has its own plans, surprises, and magic.” So never sit down - Always explore. One day, you’ll realize that miracles do happen.</p>

        <h1 id="my-winternship-journey-learning-beyond-skills">My Winternship Journey: Learning Beyond Skills</h1>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>During my internship, I realized something really important: having good skills alone isn’t enough.
What truly matters is how well we communicate, share our work, and connect with people.</p>

<p>Earlier, I believed that if I just worked hard and built strong technical skills, that would automatically speak for itself. But this experience taught me that if we don’t express our ideas or put ourselves out there, our work often goes unnoticed.</p>

<p>So I slowly started opening up more talking to people, asking questions, and sharing what I was learning. And honestly, that changed everything for me.</p>

<h3 id="exploring-beyond-my-work">Exploring Beyond My Work</h3>

<p>Throughout the internship, I tried to stay curious and explore what others around me were working on. I followed projects, read posts, interacted with mentors, and just stayed engaged.</p>

<p>That’s when my perspective on technology especially AI really shifted. Earlier, all I heard were fears like “AI will take jobs” or “AI will replace humans.” But when I saw how AI is actually being applied in real life, my mindset changed.</p>

<p>I understood that AI isn’t here to compete with us it’s here to support us.</p>

<h3 id="the-real-purpose-of-technology">The Real Purpose of Technology</h3>

<p>One big takeaway from this journey was that technology only matters when it truly helps people.</p>

<p>It’s not about building something super complex just for the sake of it.
It’s about solving real problems in education, healthcare, agriculture, workplaces, and daily life.</p>

<p>This made me realize that technology isn’t a threat.
It’s a tool to make life better as long as we use it responsibly.</p>

<h3 id="big-impact-can-come-from-simple-ideas">Big Impact Can Come From Simple Ideas</h3>

<p>Another major lesson I learned was this:</p>

<p>Not every impactful solution has to be complicated.</p>

<p>Sometimes the simplest ideas make the biggest difference.</p>

<p>Earlier, I used to think innovation meant advanced systems, deep tech, and heavy data work. But now I see the value of first-principles thinking — going back to the basics and asking:</p>

<p>What simple solution can actually solve this problem well?</p>

<p>This mindset helped me appreciate thoughtful, practical solutions over flashy complexity.</p>

<h3 id="personal-growth-that-matters-to-me">Personal Growth That Matters to Me</h3>

<p>Beyond technical learning, this internship helped me grow as a person.
I became:</p>

<p>more confident in expressing myself</p>

<p>more comfortable sharing ideas</p>

<p>better at collaborating</p>

<p>more open to networking</p>

<p>clearer in my thinking</p>

<p>It helped me step out of my comfort zone and that’s something I really value.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Looking back, this internship showed me that real impact happens when skills, communication, and purpose come together.</p>

<p>Technology alone can’t change the world but people who use it thoughtfully definitely can.</p>

<p>This journey didn’t just teach me new tools.
It changed how I think, learn, and look at the future.</p>

<p>And I’m truly grateful for that experience.</p>

        <p>It all started on December 22nd. I remember looking at the clock—8:45 AM to nearly 7:00 PM. The sheer scale of the day was intimidating. When the goal was announced—completing the MERN stack in such a short time—I’ll be honest: I was scared.</p>

<p>In those early hours, I felt like an observer. Watching others interact confidently with Sudarshan Sir made me feel a bit left out, like everyone else had a secret map I was missing. But that feeling didn’t last long, because the journey was designed to pull me in.</p>

<h1 id="beyond-the-tutorials-easter-eggs-and-case-studies">Beyond the Tutorials: Easter Eggs and Case Studies</h1>
<p>As I dove into the ViBe platform, the MERN course became more than just videos. Nandan Sir’s teaching style turned a daunting stack into something manageable. I even found myself smiling at the small details—like the “Easter egg” Mukund Sir tucked into the Express section. It made the learning feel human, not robotic.</p>

<p>I wasn’t just “watching” code; I was “wrestling” with it. It took me two weeks of persistence, but finishing that course felt like a massive personal victory.</p>

<h1 id="a-culture-of-collaboration">A Culture of Collaboration</h1>
<p>One of the most beautiful aspects of this internship was the culture developed among the students. It wasn’t just about individual progress; it was about the community. I found myself in an environment where everyone was eager to help one another. Whether it was a doubt in the breakout rooms or a bug in a case study, there was always a fellow intern ready to lend a hand. This spirit of “growing together” was awsome.</p>

<h1 id="the-support-system">The Support System</h1>
<p>What kept me going through the intensity wasn’t just the code, but the people:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Daily Spark: Sakshi Mam’s engaging activities .</li>
  <li>The Safety Net: Whenever I felt stuck, the support from Jinal Mam and Nitin Sir made the hurdles feel smaller.</li>
  <li>The Direction: Sudarshan Sir’s daily motivation and Meenakshi Mam’s guidance helped me see the bigger picture—that this wasn’t just about learning a framework, but about building a developer’s mindset.</li>

<h1 id="my-takeaway">My Takeaway</h1>
<p>Looking back at that first day on December 22nd, I realize that the “scare” was necessary. Being “left out” was just a temporary phase before I stepped into the flow. I’m walking away from this not just with a certificate, but with the knowledge that I can tackle a massive challenge if I just stay consistent and lean into the community around me.</p>

        <p>I am Prajakta, a second-year Computer Engineering student. This internship with VLED Lab at IIT Ropar is my first internship ever, and even now, writing that feels a little unreal.</p>

<p>When my NPTEL results came out and I found myself in the Top 5% category, I was happy. My family was happy. Everyone felt proud. At that moment, I knew something good might come out of it—but I didn’t know how or when. A few months later, an email arrived. I registered, received the offer letter, and just like that, I stepped into my first professional learning experience.</p>

<p>Before joining, I was extremely excited and curious. I kept wondering—what will we learn, how will this be different, what will people be like? Then came Day 1: the orientation. It felt energetic, welcoming, and motivating. The mentors and the people I met didn’t feel distant or intimidating. They felt real, approachable, and genuinely invested.</p>

<p>One thing that stood out from the very beginning was the daily morning sessions on Zoom. They don’t feel like routine meetings. They carry a certain positivity that lifts my mood every day. Everyone gets a chance to share experiences, thoughts, or doubts. Initially, I was hesitant to speak. I overthought—What if I say something wrong? What if people judge? But as I saw others sharing openly, I gathered the courage to speak once.</p>

<p>That one time changed everything.</p>

<p>After sharing my experience, the hesitation slowly disappeared. Now, if I have a doubt—or even if someone else has one—I feel confident enough to raise my hand, speak, or answer. I don’t think twice anymore about how people will react. Somewhere along the way, I gained confidence I didn’t even realise I was building.</p>

<p>I still remember a moment from the very first day when someone asked why we need to learn development when AI exists and might replace us. The discussion that followed made one thing clear—AI cannot work without human logic and reasoning. There will always be gaps that need human thinking. That conversation reassured me and strengthened my belief in learning core skills.</p>

<p>Our technical learning began with MERN stack development on the ViBe platform. The videos are short, focused, and engaging, followed by quizzes that ensure active learning. If you move away or speak loudly, the video rewinds. At first, it felt strict, but soon I realised how effective it was.</p>

<p>In the first two days, there were some enrollment issues, but what mattered was how the team handled them. Those who weren’t enrolled yet were given live sessions, which showed genuine concern for our learning.</p>

<p>Initially, deadlines were given, but later they were removed and everything became self-paced. This shift taught me self-discipline—no pressure, no chasing, just responsibility. We were also introduced to case studies and breakout rooms where people discuss, collaborate, and learn together. I joined a few sessions, and each time I gained a new perspective.</p>

<p>During one session, we discussed the idea of the strength of weak ties. Over time, I began seeing it in action. Mentors, peers from different colleges, and teammates in breakout rooms—people I barely knew at the start—have influenced my learning and thinking through small but meaningful interactions.</p>

<p>If I reflect on what I’ve learned so far, it’s not just technical knowledge—though MERN stack was completely new to me and now I understand its concepts. More importantly, I’ve learned to speak up, trust my voice, and share my thoughts confidently.</p>

<p>As I move forward in this internship, my next milestone is the viva—not just as an evaluation, but as a doorway to real project work. Clearing it means that learning will turn into responsibility, where I’ll be expected to contribute meaningfully. That thought excites me and scares me at the same time, but it has also made me more aware that what is expected from me is not perfection, but initiative, clarity, and the willingness to take responsibility, even in small ways.</p>

<p>In just two weeks, this internship has begun to influence how learning, growth, and responsibility are understood. With the journey still ongoing, there is much more to learn and experience.✨</p>

        <h1 id="an-internship-journey">An Internship Journey</h1>

<p>I logged into my <strong>IIT Ropar</strong> internship expecting lessons. What I didn’t expect was a quiet upgrade to my thinking software.</p>

<p>Two weeks in, this experience has turned out to be far more meaningful than a checklist of tasks or outcomes. What stands out is not a single assignment, but the way this internship subtly reshapes how problems are approached and questions are framed.</p>

<p>A core part of the journey has been the <strong>daily meetings and Zoom breakout rooms</strong>, where interns collaborate on case studies, brainstorm ideas, and challenge assumptions together. These sessions feel less like meetings and more like idea gyms where thinking is exercised and perspectives evolve. Even in a virtual setup, a strong sense of connection exists, strengthened by all interns being linked through <strong>LinkedIn</strong>, turning peers into an active professional network.</p>

<p>Building <strong>MERN stack codes from scratch</strong> reinforces the value of fundamentals, patience, and clarity. The quizzes are high-dopamine and oddly addictive, while the <strong>ViBe course</strong> delivers short, sharp, YouTube-Shorts–style content that makes learning feel effortless.</p>

<p>Above all, this internship values <strong>depth over speed</strong>. Credit goes to the organizing team for designing an experience that feels intentional, engaging, and genuinely enjoyable.</p>

<p>Two weeks in, comfort zones are shrinking, curiosity is growing and that feels like exactly the point.</p>

        <h1 id="my-winternship-journey-learning-beyond-skills">My Winternship Journey: Learning Beyond Skills</h1>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>This internship taught me a very important lesson: <strong>even if we have the right skill set, our work is not impactful if we do not show it or communicate it properly</strong>. Skills alone are not enough. Opening up, communicating, and networking are equally important.</p>

<p>Through this experience, I clearly understood how crucial it is to express our ideas, share our work, and connect with people. Networking is not optional anymore it plays a key role in personal and professional growth.</p>

<h3 id="being-active-and-exploring-new-initiatives">Being Active and Exploring New Initiatives</h3>

<p>During this internship, I was active on LinkedIn and started exploring different projects and initiatives. One such project that really stood out to me was <strong>Annam.ai</strong>, which is a great initiative by the Indian government and the IITs to explore how AI can be implemented in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Before this, most of what I heard about AI was negative — things like <em>AI will replace jobs</em>, <em>AI will do everything</em>, and similar fears. But after exploring projects like Annam.ai and others, my perspective completely changed.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-real-purpose-of-ai">Understanding the Real Purpose of AI</h3>

<p>I realized that <strong>AI is not about replacing humans</strong>. Instead, it is about how we can use AI to improve development and productivity. It is about how we can implement AI in our daily lives and in key sectors of our country such as <strong>education, health, and agriculture</strong>, to make our country more developed and to improve the lifestyle and sustainability of people.</p>

<p>One thing I can now surely confirm through this experience is that <strong>AI will not dominate or damage our lives</strong>. It is here to improve productivity, and it is our responsibility to implement it properly and adapt ourselves to it.</p>

<h3 id="learning-from-simple-yet-powerful-ideas">Learning from Simple Yet Powerful Ideas</h3>

<p>I also came across a few posts by <strong>Sudarshan sir</strong>, and one particular post included a stand-up comedy video that highlighted the <strong>overuse and unnecessary over-implementation of technology in daily life</strong>. That post made me reflect on how we often try to solve every problem using complex technical solutions, even when simpler approaches can be more effective. From this, I learned that we should not always think in an overly technical or complicated way.</p>

<p>Sometimes, what we really need is <strong>first-principles thinking</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, when we hear that initiatives like <strong>Annam.ai</strong> and the government are investing around <strong>₹300 crore in AI for agriculture</strong>, most of us immediately imagine advanced and futuristic technologies such as detection models, heavy data analysis, and complex AI pipelines. While these approaches are important and will certainly be implemented, what impressed me the most was their focus on simple yet highly impactful ideas.</p>

<p>One such project under Annam.ai uses managed honey <strong>beehives</strong>. By placing beehives in and around crop fields, bees systematically visit flowers and carry out effective pollination. This managed pollination significantly increases the percentage of flowers that turn into fruits or seeds, leading to massive improvements in yield in some cases up to 152% higher. Along with increased crop production, the same bees also produce honey and pollen, giving farmers additional sources of income and making the solution both economically beneficial and sustainable.</p>

<p>This clearly shows that even without implementing complex AI algorithms, a simple and well-thought-out intervention can create an enormous impact. Sometimes, basic steps, when applied in the right way, can outperform even the most advanced technological solutions.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>This experience taught me that <strong>impact does not always come from advanced technology alone</strong>. Sometimes, simple ideas implemented in the right way can create huge change. We should learn to think differently and not always jump directly to advanced technical solutions.</p>

<p>Overall, this internship helped me grow not just technically, but also in terms of mindset, communication, networking, and understanding the real role of technology especially AI in shaping a better future.</p>

      <div style="prose max-width: none; text-align: justify;">
        <p>I stepped into the NPTEL Winter Internship (Winternship) with VLED Labs at <strong>IIT ROPAR</strong> with a simple expectation: to gain technical skills and grow as a developer.</p>

<p>What I didn’t expect was a shift in how I understand learning itself.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, learning felt both exciting and peaceful—a balance I had never experienced before. In a world that constantly pushes us to move faster, this internship encouraged something different: slowing down to truly understand. There was no pressure to chase deadlines blindly. Instead, the focus was on building concepts deeply, embracing confusion, and thinking critically from first principles before moving toward advanced outcomes.</p>

<p>Before this journey, learning for me often meant speed. Watching content quickly, completing tasks, and moving ahead even when clarity was incomplete. Progress felt tied to how much I finished, not how much I understood. This experience challenged that mindset completely.</p>

<p>The ViBe learning platform reinforced this shift. Short, focused lessons combined with quizzes made learning active and intentional. Moving forward required real clarity, not assumptions. It made me realize how often familiarity can be mistaken for understanding.</p>

<p>The case studies were another defining part of the journey. Designed to reflect industry-level problems, they offered insight into how real-world challenges are approached. Solutions rarely came from a single person. They emerged through collaboration—breaking problems down together, sharing perspectives, debating ideas, and gradually arriving at a common solution. Learning felt collective rather than individual.</p>

<p>Despite being an online internship with over 300 participants from different parts of a diverse country like India, the experience never felt distant. Daily stand-ups and breakout room discussions created consistency and connection. During one of the sessions, <strong>Dr. Sudarshan Sir</strong> spoke about <strong>the strength of weak ties</strong>—how connections with people outside our immediate circles often lead to new ideas, perspectives, and growth. That idea came alive here. Interacting with peers I had never met before, learning from their approaches, and thinking alongside them made the experience richer and more expansive.</p>

<p>Starting the day with fun and engaging interactive sessions led by Sudarshan Iyengar Sir , Meenakshi V Ma’am, Harshdeep R. Ma’am , Jinal Gupta Ma’am , Nitin Sankar Sir , and Sakshi Sharma Ma’am soon became a habit. These sessions set a positive tone and brought clarity and motivation. Later in the day, technical walkthroughs of real-world projects conducted by Nandan Prabhudesai Sir , Rohit Sharma Sir helped bridge the gap between concepts and practical implementation.</p>

<p>What truly defined this journey were the people—mentors who emphasized <strong>depth over shortcuts</strong>, and peers who supported one another through discussion and shared effort. Even in a virtual environment, collaboration felt natural and meaningful.</p>

<p>This internship did not bring instant transformation. Instead, it reshaped habits and perspectives over time.</p>

<p>I leave this experience with a deeper understanding that learning does not need urgency to be effective.</p>

<p>That struggle is not a setback, but a part of growth.</p>

<p>And that meaningful progress often becomes visible only when we <strong>pause and reflect</strong>.</p>

<p>This journey didn’t just teach me how to build things.</p>

<p>It taught me how to learn.</p>

        <p>The NPTEL Winter Internship at IIT Ropar marks an important turning point in my learning journey. This internship is not just about completing tasks, but about understanding how disciplined, concept-driven learning shapes a strong technical foundation.</p>

<p>During the first phase of the internship, I began learning through the Vibe platform, where each topic is delivered through short, focused videos followed by quizzes. This structured approach encouraged me to slow down, reflect, and truly understand concepts instead of rushing through them. Through this process, I started building clarity in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, MongoDB, and Express.</p>

<p>What made this experience meaningful for me was the emphasis on thinking logically before coding. The internship promotes problem-solving through case-study-oriented learning, which helped me identify gaps in my understanding and approach problems with greater confidence. This method has changed how I look at learning technology — prioritizing depth over surface-level knowledge.</p>

<p>This internship has reinforced my interest in full-stack development and given me confidence in structured self-learning. I am grateful to NPTEL, IIT Ropar, Vicharanashala, and Annam.ai for providing this opportunity, and I sincerely appreciate the guidance and vision of Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar and the mentor team at IIT Ropar.</p>

<p>As I continue this internship, I look forward to gaining deeper practical exposure, strengthening my problem-solving abilities, and growing steadily as a learner and developer.</p>

        <blockquote>
  <p><em>“Gratitude opens the door. Responsibility decides how far you walk.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before joining this winter internship, the first emotion I felt was <strong>gratitude</strong>.<br />
Being selected itself felt like recognition  a quiet validation of effort, patience, and persistence. At that moment, I wasn’t thinking about outcomes or certificates. I was simply thankful for the opportunity to be here.</p>

<p>But once the internship actually began, that feeling evolved.</p>

<p>Gratitude slowly transformed into <strong>responsibility</strong>.</p>

<p>Responsibility to show up.<br />
Responsibility to stay consistent.<br />
Responsibility to carry myself not just as a learner, but as a contributor.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-a-shift-in-mindset">🌱 A Shift in Mindset</h2>

<p>This internship didn’t announce its impact loudly.<br />
Instead, it worked silently  upgrading how I think, focus, and engage.</p>

<p>It became clear very early that this was <strong>not a passive experience</strong>.<br />
The structure itself demands intention.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“You don’t just attend this internship  you participate in it.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2 id="-learning-on-the-vibe-platform-focus-redefined">🎥 Learning on the ViBe Platform: Focus Redefined</h2>

<p>One of the most distinctive parts of this journey has been learning through the <strong>ViBe platform</strong>.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional online courses, ViBe enforces <strong>deep focus and discipline</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Computer vision technology ensures attention remains on the screen</li>
  <li>Multitasking and distractions are minimized</li>
  <li>Every video concludes with a <strong>quiz</strong>, reinforcing understanding instantly</li>
</ul>

<p>Initially, this strict focus felt challenging. But over time, I realized:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Focus is not forced here  it is trained.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The structure transforms learning from passive watching into <strong>active engagement</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="️-from-watching-to-doing-mern-stack--case-studies">🛠️ From Watching to Doing: MERN Stack &amp; Case Studies</h2>

<p>Learning doesn’t stop at videos. After completing modules, we move into <strong>hands-on case studies</strong>, especially around the <strong>MERN stack</strong>.</p>

<p>These case studies help:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Translate theory into practice</li>
  <li>Strengthen conceptual clarity</li>
  <li>Encourage collaborative problem-solving</li>
</ul>

<p>To support this, interns are grouped into <strong>Zoom breakout rooms</strong>, where discussions feel more like idea labs than meetings.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“When perspectives meet, understanding deepens.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actively participated in brainstorming, implementation, and debugging within my group, ensuring I was involved not just in listening, but in <strong>doing</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-mentorship-guidance--daily-engagement">🤝 Mentorship, Guidance &amp; Daily Engagement</h2>

  <li>Effective learning and thinking strategies</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>daily assignments guided by Rohit Sharma Sir and Sakshi Sharma Madam</strong> played a crucial role in solidifying concepts through consistent practical application, ensuring that learning remained structured and progressive.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-contribution-beyond-the-classroom">🌐 Contribution Beyond the Classroom</h2>

<p>One of the moments I’m most proud of during this internship is contributing beyond my own learning.</p>

<p>I actively helped in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compiling structured <strong>case study notes</strong></li>
  <li>Collaborating with peers to build a <strong>website</strong> for easy access to shared learning materials</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Learning multiplies when it is shared.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This initiative strengthened both my understanding and my sense of responsibility toward the learning community.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Sometimes, opportunities arrive quietly—through consistent effort, curiosity, and a willingness to learn. Looking back at my internship journey, I feel grateful, humbled, and deeply motivated.</p>

<p>As part of my academic curriculum, my college required us to appear for an <strong>NPTEL examination</strong>. I chose <strong>Cloud Computing</strong> as my subject. What started as a mandatory requirement soon became an area of genuine interest. I dedicated myself to understanding the concepts, explored beyond the syllabus, and prepared thoroughly for the examination. When the results were announced, I was pleasantly surprised to score <strong>87%</strong> and receive a <strong>Topper Badge (Top 5%)</strong>. That moment was special—it was a tangible validation of my hard work and learning.</p>

<h2 id="summer-internship-opportunity">Summer Internship Opportunity</h2>

<p>Shortly after, I received an email from <strong>NPTEL</strong> announcing <strong>Summer Internship opportunities exclusively for course toppers</strong>. I applied with excitement and hope, and I was fortunate to be selected.</p>

<p>My <strong>two-month Summer Internship (May–July)</strong> was under the guidance of <strong>Prof. Sudharshan Sir at IIT Ropar</strong>. During this internship, I gained strong exposure to real-world problem-solving, contributed to an <strong>open-source project</strong>, and learned how academic knowledge translates into practical implementation. Successfully completing the project, receiving the internship certificate, and being awarded a <strong>stipend of ₹10,000</strong> made the experience even more fulfilling.</p>

<h2 id="an-unexpected-second-opportunity">An Unexpected Second Opportunity</h2>

<p>Just when I thought the journey had reached a milestone, something unexpected happened.</p>

<p>A couple of months later, I received another email—an invitation for the <strong>NPTEL Winter Internship</strong>. I was honestly shocked. Getting an opportunity to intern at an IIT for the <strong>second time</strong>, again under the guidance of the same professor, felt unreal. Coming from a <strong>non-IIT, non-NIT, non-IIIT background</strong>, this experience reinforced my belief that <strong>consistent effort and learning truly matter more than labels</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="winter-internship-experience">Winter Internship Experience</h2>

<p>The <strong>Winter Internship</strong> experience was significantly different and even more enriching. The internship structure evolved into a highly professional and industry-aligned environment that included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A complete <strong>MERN stack learning program</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Daily stand-up meetings</strong></li>
  <li>Active communication through <strong>Zoho channels</strong></li>
  <li>Exposure to a <strong>self-built open-source application</strong></li>
  <li>Strong collaboration and networking with fellow interns from diverse backgrounds</li>
</ul>

<p>My daily routine became something I genuinely looked forward to—logging in by <strong>8:45 AM</strong>, participating in team discussions, and working from <strong>9:30 AM to 6:00 PM</strong>, often beyond, driven not by obligation but by enthusiasm to grow and contribute meaningfully.</p>

<h2 id="overcoming-initial-fear">Overcoming Initial Fear</h2>

<p>On the first day, I felt a sense of nervousness, assuming that most interns would be from highly reputed universities. However, as days passed, I realized something important—<strong>everyone was here to learn</strong>, regardless of their background. That realization boosted my confidence and helped me focus purely on growth rather than comparison.</p>

<h2 id="learning-through-practice">Learning Through Practice</h2>

<p>What stood out most was the <strong>learning methodology</strong>. Alongside structured MERN stack learning, we were given <strong>real-world case studies</strong>, pushing us to apply concepts practically rather than memorizing theory. This hands-on exposure helped me develop not just technical skills, but also <strong>problem-solving ability, teamwork, and discipline</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="reflection-and-gratitude">Reflection and Gratitude</h2>

<p>Looking back, I truly feel fortunate to have spent nearly <strong>three months interning under the guidance of an IIT professor and his team</strong>. This journey has shaped my perspective, strengthened my technical foundation, and motivated me to aim higher with clarity and confidence.</p>

<p>I am deeply grateful to <strong>NPTEL</strong>, <strong>Prof. Sudharshan Sir</strong>, the internship team, and my fellow interns for making this journey memorable. This experience will always remain a milestone in my learning journey.</p>

<h2 id="closing-note">Closing Note</h2>

<p>Here’s to <strong>continuous learning</strong>, staying curious, and believing in the <strong>power of consistent effort</strong>.</p>

        <p>Not all learning happens in classrooms. Some of the most impactful lessons come from structured experiences that challenge both <strong>skill and mindset</strong>. My experience during the <strong>NPTEL Winter Internship at IIT Ropar</strong>, under the guidance of <strong>Professor Sudarshan Iyengar</strong>, reshaped my daily routine, strengthened my confidence, and encouraged consistent learning. This article reflects on that journey—filled with <strong>meaningful changes, real challenges, and deep gratitude</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="the-unexpected-start-from-doubt-to-enthusiasm"><strong>The Unexpected Start: From Doubt to Enthusiasm</strong></h3>

<p>It began with a suggestion from my professor to take the <strong>NPTEL Programming in Java exam</strong>. At first, my friends and I hesitated due to the <strong>effort and cost involved</strong>. But we decided to try it. To our surprise, we all did well—earning spots in the <strong>Elite + Gold category</strong> and invitations to this <strong>prestigious internship</strong>.</p>

<p>When the selection email came, I felt a wave of <strong>excitement and disbelief</strong>. This virtual program at <strong>IIT Ropar</strong> turned out to feel like <strong>living my IIT dream</strong>, right from my laptop.</p>

<p>The internship began on <strong>December 22, 2025</strong>, with a <strong>9 AM Zoom meeting</strong>. I was anxious—<em>could I keep up?</em> But the first session, led by the engaging <strong>Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar sir</strong>, changed everything. His encouraging words, along with support from <strong>Meenakshi V Mam</strong> and the team, eased my worries. Soon, <strong>starting my day early</strong> became something I genuinely looked forward to.</p>

<h3 id="daily-lessons-from-skills-to-self-improvement"><strong>Daily Lessons: From Skills to Self-Improvement</strong></h3>

<p>This is <strong>not a standard internship</strong> with simple lectures and a certificate. It is <strong>hands-on and well-organized</strong>, built around the <strong>ViBe platform</strong>—short videos, focused quizzes, and tools that kept us on track.</p>

<p>We covered a <strong>modern course on the MERN stack</strong>, expertly taught by <strong>Nandan Prabhudesai Sir</strong>, working through <strong>challenging case studies</strong> that tested my limits. The <strong>React modules</strong> were tough at times, but <strong>breakout rooms</strong> led to lively discussions where fellow interns helped explain ideas clearly. In a short time, I completed the <strong>entire MERN module</strong>—something I once believed was out of reach.</p>

<h3 id="beyond-coding-skills-that-truly-matter"><strong>Beyond Coding: Skills That Truly Matter</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Teamwork:</strong><br />
Breakout rooms sparked <strong>lively discussions</strong> with interns from all over India, often lasting late into the night. Sharing ideas, fixing code issues, and expanding my network through <strong>LinkedIn</strong> helped me connect more during this program than in my entire <strong>BTech journey so far</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Building Habits and Confidence:</strong><br />
Daily meetings built <strong>discipline without pressure</strong>. I overcame challenges like microphone issues and the fear of losing points to <strong>speak up confidently</strong>—hoping <strong>Sudarshan Sir</strong> would notice my name in the list! These small wins greatly strengthened my <strong>self-belief</strong>.</p>

<p>We also had open interactions with mentors including <strong>Jinal Gupta</strong>, <strong>Nitin Sankar</strong>, and the team at <strong>Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design</strong>. Activities like <strong>polls, quizzes, and group tasks</strong> kept sessions engaging and built a strong sense of <strong>community across distances</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="reflections-a-clearer-mind-and-stronger-focus"><strong>Reflections: A Clearer Mind and Stronger Focus</strong></h3>

<p>I can already see clear improvements—<strong>better focus, reduced procrastination, and satisfaction after completing tough case studies</strong>. My daily routine shifted from <strong>irregular study hours</strong> to <strong>consistent, goal-driven effort</strong>.</p>

<p>This internship was about <strong>more than technical skills</strong>. It reshaped <strong>how I think and approach challenges</strong>. It taught me that real progress comes from <strong>collaboration, patience, and persistence</strong>.</p>

<p>I truly hope the bonds—both <strong>professional and personal</strong>—last long after the program. A heartfelt thanks to the entire team, including <strong>Harshdeep R.</strong> and <strong>Nitin Sankar</strong>, for creating such a <strong>supportive and inspiring environment</strong>. Your dedication genuinely made a difference.</p>

<p>This experience has motivated me to <strong>keep learning, growing, and improving every single day</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="my-online-internship-experience-at-iit-ropar">My Online Internship Experience at IIT Ropar</h1>

<p>Hello everyone, I would like to share my genuine and honest experience from my internship. I recently got an opportunity to do an internship at IIT Ropar. At first, I felt a little sad because the internship was completely online. But later, I realized that an online internship can actually be very beneficial. You might not agree at first, but by the end of this blog, you’ll understand why I feel this way.</p>

<p>When I saw the offer letter, I thought it would be a normal internship where we learn from some materials, work on a project, and finally get a certificate. But this internship was very different. As a final-year student, managing college work along with an internship is not easy.</p>

<p>On the first day, the internship timing was from 9 am to 6 pm with only short breaks. This made me nervous, and I felt worried that I wouldn’t get enough time for my own preparation.</p>

<p>On the same day, I met Professor Sudarshan Iyengar sir, who started the session. He is one of my favorite professors because earlier, when I visited IIT Madras, I attended one of his lectures and really enjoyed it. At that time, I wanted to talk to him but couldn’t. So, getting selected for an internship under his guidance later felt very special and lucky to me.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the internship, we were asked to complete some modern courses on the ViBe platform. These course was challenging, but the learning experience was really good. The platform is designed in a way that helps students stay focused without getting distracted. Along with the courses, we were also given case studies for each topic. These helped me understand the concepts better because just listening to lectures is not enough without practice.</p>

<p>Even though we have completed only two weeks of the internship, I have learned a lot during this time. It has improved not only my subject knowledge but also my daily routine and concentration. There is a clear difference in my life before and after the internship.</p>

<p>I am attending the daily stand-ups at sharp 9 am and turning on our videos, not because it is compulsory, but because of my pure interest and excitement to join the session. Our teachers— Sudarshan Iyengar Sir, Meenakshi V Ma’am, Sakshi Sharma Ma’am, @Bhavna Ma’am, @Harshadeep Ma’am, Jinal Gupta Ma’am, Nitin Sankar Sir—and last but not the least, the fellow interns, make these sessions much more interesting day by day. They are coming up with more interesting activities. They conduct polls during the Zoom sessions, conduct quizzes, and also conduct sessions on learning new things. Also I want to specially thank Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design for providng us this smooth experience and providing valuable insights.</p>

<p>One of the best parts of this internship is interacting with fellow interns. We got the chance to connect with people from different parts of India and with different ways of thinking. We connected on LinkedIn and improved our networking. The most enjoyable part was discussing ideas, learning together, sharing knowledge, and solving problems or code in breakout rooms. Sometimes, our discussions even went on till 2 am at night.</p>

<p>Overall, the learning experience has been very good. It changed the way I think and focus. Studying in an IIT has always been my dream, and in some way, this internship made that dream come true. It feels a little sad that only two weeks are left, but that’s something we can’t change. I truly hope that the connections we built with fellow interns continue even after the internship ends.</p>

<p>One more thing I want to mention is that if this internship were offline, we might not have had so many chances to interact with our professors so freely. All the teachers were very kind, supportive, and friendly. Also, late-night discussions like the ones we had in breakout rooms wouldn’t have been possible.</p>

<p>I would like to sincerely thank all the teachers for their hard work and support. I strongly recommend not missing this opportunity. This internship can really help you grow and learn a lot. Missing it would mean missing something valuable.</p>

<p>Thank you for giving me the chance to share my experience through this internship.</p>

<p>Taking up the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) Stack internship training and completing it within two weeks was both challenging and immensely skill-building. It made me realize how much can be achieved in such a short period with the right guidance and dedication.</p>

<p>The ViBe platform stood out as unique and highly effective, even with its structured restrictions. As an AI learning platform, it supported focused learning by monitoring anomalies, ensuring minimal distractions along with consistent engagement. Being part of this learning journey allowed us to contribute to the internship team’s research and platform improvements. I truly appreciate the time and effort invested by the ViBe development team, who consistently delivered timely fixes at short notice, enabling us to progress smoothly toward completion.</p>

<p>Following the theoretical training, we transitioned to MERN Stack case studies that were both challenging and engaging. These were designed using real-world analogies, making complex concepts easier to understand. The step-by-step walkthroughs along with interactive challenges, further strengthened our practical understanding.</p>

<p>The live mentor sessions played a crucial role in addressing doubts and guiding us throughout the journey. Beyond encouraging timely completion, the mentors emphasized understanding the implementation and focusing on meaningful learning. Daily quizzes helped reinforce technical concepts, while the interview process significantly boosted confidence and preparedness for real-world projects.</p>

<p>We were also given the opportunity to work on projects that integrate Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning within the education and other domains. I am grateful for the chance to collaborate with experienced developers and mentors, whose guidance made this training truly valuable.</p>

<p>Overall, the journey so far has been genuinely engaging, enjoyable, and enriching.</p>
