<h1 id="a-internship-journey">A Internship Journey</h1>

<p>I logged into my <strong>IIT Ropar</strong> internship expecting lessons. What I didn’t expect was a quiet upgrade to my thinking software.</p>

<p>Two weeks in, this experience has turned out to be far more meaningful than a checklist of tasks or outcomes. What stands out is not a single assignment, but the way this internship subtly reshapes how problems are approached and questions are framed.</p>

<p>A core part of the journey has been the <strong>daily meetings and Zoom breakout rooms</strong>, where interns collaborate on case studies, brainstorm ideas, and challenge assumptions together. These sessions feel less like meetings and more like idea gyms where thinking is exercised and perspectives evolve. Even in a virtual setup, a strong sense of connection exists, strengthened by all interns being linked through <strong>LinkedIn</strong>, turning peers into an active professional network.</p>

<p>Building <strong>MERN stack codes from scratch</strong> reinforces the value of fundamentals, patience, and clarity. The quizzes are high-dopamine and oddly addictive, while the <strong>ViBe course</strong> delivers short, sharp, YouTube-Shorts–style content that makes learning feel effortless.</p>

<p>Above all, this internship values <strong>depth over speed</strong>. Credit goes to the organizing team for designing an experience that feels intentional, engaging, and genuinely enjoyable.</p>

<p>Two weeks in, comfort zones are shrinking, curiosity is growing and that feels like exactly the point.</p>
