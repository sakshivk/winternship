<h2 id="a-nervous-start">A Nervous Start</h2>
<p>On the first day of my first internship, the schedule was from 9 AM to 6 PM continuously, with only a few short breaks. I was honestly scared after seeing the timings. But as the days passed, I realized that instead of losing time, I was actually finding myself. I finally understood where I was standing, what I was lacking, and how I could improve.</p>

<h2 id="learning-by-doing">Learning by Doing</h2>
<p>Learning here does not stop with watching videos. After completing the modules, we move into hands-on case studies, where real thinking and problem-solving begin. This was the first time I experienced learning that truly challenged me, and it made me feel like I was slowly becoming a real developer, not just a student. At that moment, I realized this was not going to be just an internship.</p>

<h2 id="morning-mentorship">Morning Mentorship</h2>
<p>Every day at 9 AM during the stand-up sessions, I see our teachers — Professor Sudarshan Iyengar Sir, Meenakshi Ma’am, Sakshi Ma’am, Bhavna Ma’am, Harshadeep Ma’am, Jinal Gupta Ma’am, and Nitin Shankar Sir — bringing such positive energy. The way Meenakshi Ma’am starts the day with a smile fills me with the same positivity. The session by Sudarshan Sir always boosts motivation, gives good direction, and reminds me why I chose this field. The fellow interns make each session more interesting and lively. The way Nandhan Sir explained the ViBe course, along with the extra sessions he takes, helped us learn beyond expectations. The session by Sakshi Ma’am was especially interesting because it taught us much more than just MERN.</p>

<h2 id="two-week-change">Two-Week Change</h2>
<p>We have completed only two weeks of the internship, and in this short time I have learned so much. Life before the internship and life after the internship are not the same. Every single day gives me a new chance to change, to grow, and to become better. I stopped doom scrolling, I started waking up early so I would never miss the 9 AM stand-up, and I now try to improve myself a little more every day. These small habits make me proud, especially because this is my very first internship.</p>

<h2 id="deep-learning">Deep Learning</h2>
<p>Sudarshan Sir and the entire team continuously introduce new activities that make learning enjoyable and meaningful. They conduct live polls during Zoom sessions, quizzes, interactive discussions, and special learning sessions. Discussing in breakout rooms with peers and solving case studies together made learning even more engaging and practical. This internship values depth over speed, and that completely changed the way I approach learning.</p>

<h2 id="a-dream-fulfilled-and-gratitude">A Dream Fulfilled and Gratitude</h2>
<p>Overall, this experience has been truly life-changing. It transformed the way I think, study, and focus. Studying in an IIT has always been a dream for me, and in this form, through this internship, I feel that dream has been fulfilled. As my first internship, this journey will always remain special to me. Above all, I feel deep gratitude and thankfulness toward all the teachers who work so hard for our growth, not just as developers, but as individuals.</p>
