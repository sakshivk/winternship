<p>We tested two products developed at Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar under Sudarshan Iyengar specifically designed for Gen Z learning. Now that we have used these products ourselves, we are ready to contribute to these open-source projects on GitHub.</p>

<p>These products were designed following extensive research into the unique learning challenges and short attention spans of Gen Z.</p>

<p><strong>𝐕𝐢𝐁𝐞</strong>: A Modern Learning Platform ViBe is open-source software designed to replace conventional teaching with more engaging, AI-driven methods. It transforms long lectures into short, manageable chunks and adds AI-generated, context-aware questions to keep learners actively involved.</p>

<p>It even tracks attention levels, helping teachers ensure every student stays focused.</p>

<p><strong>𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐦</strong>: Real-Time Engagement, AI-integrated web application for conducting live polls during online sessions. This system creates polls at key moments based on the ongoing Zoom meeting to keep participants engaged and attentive.</p>
