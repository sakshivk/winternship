<p>I joined this internship believing that my biggest challenge would be technical learning. I assumed the difficult part would be understanding concepts, keeping up with the pace, or finishing assignments on time. What I didn’t expect was that my real struggle would be something much quieter — confidence, especially when it came to speaking.</p>

<p>In the beginning, I found myself holding back. During discussions or breakout rooms, I often knew what I wanted to say, but hesitation took over. I would overthink my words, worry about being wrong, or feel that others might express the idea better than me. So I stayed silent. Not because I wasn’t interested, but because confidence doesn’t always arrive when it’s needed.</p>

<p>This internship didn’t force me to speak. Instead, it created an environment where showing up consistently mattered more than performing perfectly. Daily stand-up sessions, regular learning on the ViBe platform, and continuous engagement slowly built a rhythm in my days. Without realizing it, discipline started forming first — waking up on time, attending sessions regularly, completing what I started.</p>

<p>And somewhere inside that discipline, confidence began to grow.</p>

<p>I noticed that when I stayed consistent, fear slowly lost its grip. Listening to others, observing how discussions unfolded, and being present every day made things feel less intimidating. Speaking didn’t feel like a test anymore. It started feeling like participation. Even when I didn’t speak, I was no longer anxious — I was learning how to be comfortable in the space.</p>

<p>What this internship taught me is that confidence doesn’t always come from bold actions. Sometimes, it comes from small habits done repeatedly. Discipline created stability, and stability made confidence possible.</p>
