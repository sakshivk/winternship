<h1 id="my-nptel-winter-internship-experience">My NPTEL WINTER INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE</h1>

<h2 id="chilakamarri-krishna-panchajanya">Chilakamarri Krishna Panchajanya</h2>

<p>When I was in my III BTech II Semester, one of my professors named Abdul S Kani suggested me and my friends to write the NPTEL Examination. At first, we were reluctant and thought about the 1000₹ we needed to spend and the amount of work I had to do to finish the weekly assignments and listen to NPTEL classes along with my college work.</p>

<p>But one fine day, we decided to go for it and applied for the NPTEL Programming in Java exam. To be honest, I did not listen to classes daily. I used to listen to classes every Sunday all at once and submit the assignment on the same day.</p>

<p>At last, the day arrived to give the NPTEL Java exam. My five other friends and I prepared so much for the exam, and after coming out of the exam hall, our faces were filled with happiness and pride that we could do the NPTEL exam well. When the results arrived, I was shocked and happy at the same time. I got 95% in Java and was in the Topper 5% and Elite + Gold category. My five other friends were also in the Elite + Gold category.</p>

<p>The same professor suggested us to apply for the NPTEL Winter Internship, which I had not heard of until that day. We applied for the internship under the guidance of Professor Sudarshan Iyengar and had little to no hope that I would get selected. But one fine day, I got an email that I was selected for the internship.</p>

<h1 id="my-experience-during-internship">My Experience during Internship</h1>

<p>The internship started on 22 December 2025 at 9:00 AM in the morning. I had no clue about what would happen, what to do, or what to learn to keep up the pace during the internship. But the very first Zoom meeting gave me enough confidence that I could manage to sail through the internship if I put in adequate effort.</p>

<p>I would wake up early in the morning every day, eagerly waiting for the Zoom meeting to start and listening to the motivation provided by Sudarshan Iyengar sir and Meenakshi ma’am. Until that very first Zoom meeting, I had no idea that Zoom had so many features.</p>

<p>During each meeting, I carefully and curiously listened to each and every word of Sudarshan sir. I learned many things during this internship. One of them was realizing that I can eat two chapathis within 3 minutes by turning off the video and carefully listening to the meeting, while being afraid that Sudarshan sir might ask why my video was off.</p>

<p>I was very eager and enthusiastic to speak every day in the meeting, and I wanted to be known to Sudarshan sir in a good way (not in a bad way).</p>

<p>Many great ideas were implemented by all the team members of the internship to ensure maximum attendance and maximum learning.</p>

<p>To be honest, until Sakshi Sharma ma’am showed us the capabilities of Google Sheets, I used to think of Google Sheets as a piece of trash.</p>

<h1 id="things-i-got-to-know-during-the-internship">Things I Got to Know during the Internship</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Zoom features</li>
  <li>Google Sheets features</li>
  <li>How to effectively use LinkedIn (which I used more in these ten days than I did in my four years of BTech)</li>
  <li>How to consistently learn the MERN stack and complete 100% progress in three days</li>
  <li>About Zoho Cliq</li>
  <li>Attendance automation</li>
</ul>

<p>After every session, my motivation reached a peak until I started feeling hungry, closed the laptop, and went to eat. But when I started doing the case studies, especially during React, my frustration also reached a peak, and at one point I wanted to throw away my laptop. Then I remembered that ChatGPT could save my laptop from being thrown away by explaining the case studies to me.</p>

<p>Honestly, for some case studies, I asked ChatGPT to explain them to me as if it were explaining to a donkey. It simplified everything as much as possible.</p>

<p>I have now finished my case studies, and my heart feels lighter, as if a heavy stone has been removed from my head. Now I am excited to work on a real-time project.</p>

<p>When I wanted to talk during Zoom sessions, a few things stopped me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sometimes the microphone felt like it was possessed by a devil</li>
  <li>Sometimes my fear stopped me from talking</li>
  <li>Another fear was health points deduction</li>
</ul>

<p>But most of the time, I spoke with Sudarshan sir, and I believe that he at least knows my name when he sees the participants list. I truly hope that I give my best for the project and make everyone remember me.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,
Chilakamarri Krishna Panchajanya</p>
