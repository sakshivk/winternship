<p>Not all learning happens in classrooms. Some of the most impactful lessons come from structured experiences that challenge both <strong>skill and mindset</strong>. My experience during the <strong>NPTEL Winter Internship at IIT Ropar</strong>, under the guidance of <strong>Professor Sudarshan Iyengar</strong>, reshaped my daily routine, strengthened my confidence, and encouraged consistent learning. This article reflects on that journey—filled with <strong>meaningful changes, real challenges, and deep gratitude</strong>.</p>

<p>It began with a suggestion from my professor to take the <strong>NPTEL Programming in Java exam</strong>. At first, my friends and I hesitated due to the <strong>effort and cost involved</strong>. But we decided to try it. To our surprise, we all did well—earning spots in the <strong>Elite + Gold category</strong> and invitations to this <strong>prestigious internship</strong>.</p>

<p>When the selection email came, I felt a wave of <strong>excitement and disbelief</strong>. This virtual program at <strong>IIT Ropar</strong> turned out to feel like <strong>living my IIT dream</strong>, right from my laptop.</p>

<p>The internship began on <strong>December 22, 2025</strong>, with a <strong>9 AM Zoom meeting</strong>. I was anxious—<em>could I keep up?</em> But the first session, led by the engaging <strong>Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar sir</strong>, changed everything. His encouraging words, along with support from <strong>Meenakshi V Mam</strong> and the team, eased my worries. Soon, <strong>starting my day early</strong> became something I genuinely looked forward to.</p>

<p>This is <strong>not a standard internship</strong> with simple lectures and a certificate. It is <strong>hands-on and well-organized</strong>, built around the <strong>ViBe platform</strong>—short videos, focused quizzes, and tools that kept us on track.</p>

<p>We covered a <strong>modern course on the MERN stack</strong>, expertly taught by <strong>Nandan Prabhudesai Sir</strong>, working through <strong>challenging case studies</strong> that tested my limits. The <strong>React modules</strong> were tough at times, but <strong>breakout rooms</strong> led to lively discussions where fellow interns helped explain ideas clearly. In a short time, I completed the <strong>entire MERN module</strong>—something I once believed was out of reach.</p>

<p><strong>Teamwork:</strong><br />
Breakout rooms sparked <strong>lively discussions</strong> with interns from all over India, often lasting late into the night. Sharing ideas, fixing code issues, and expanding my network through <strong>LinkedIn</strong> helped me connect more during this program than in my entire <strong>BTech journey so far</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Building Habits and Confidence:</strong><br />
Daily meetings built <strong>discipline without pressure</strong>. I overcame challenges like microphone issues and the fear of losing points to <strong>speak up confidently</strong>—hoping <strong>Sudarshan Sir</strong> would notice my name in the list! These small wins greatly strengthened my <strong>self-belief</strong>.</p>

<p>We also had open interactions with mentors including <strong>Jinal Gupta</strong>, <strong>Nitin Sankar</strong>, and the team at <strong>Vicharanashala Lab for Education Design</strong>. Activities like <strong>polls, quizzes, and group tasks</strong> kept sessions engaging and built a strong sense of <strong>community across distances</strong>.</p>

<p>I can already see clear improvements—<strong>better focus, reduced procrastination, and satisfaction after completing tough case studies</strong>. My daily routine shifted from <strong>irregular study hours</strong> to <strong>consistent, goal-driven effort</strong>.</p>

<p>This internship was about <strong>more than technical skills</strong>. It reshaped <strong>how I think and approach challenges</strong>. It taught me that real progress comes from <strong>collaboration, patience, and persistence</strong>.</p>

<p>I truly hope the bonds—both <strong>professional and personal</strong>—last long after the program. A heartfelt thanks to the entire team, including <strong>Harshdeep R.</strong> and <strong>Nitin Sankar</strong>, for creating such a <strong>supportive and inspiring environment</strong>. Your dedication genuinely made a difference.</p>

<p>This experience has motivated me to <strong>keep learning, growing, and improving every single day</strong>.</p>
