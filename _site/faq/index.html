<p><strong>1.2 What is the duration of this internship?</strong><br />
The internship is hosted at the Indian Institute of Technology Ropar in <strong>online mode</strong> and will be of <strong>4 weeks</strong> duration.</p>

<p><strong>1.3 What is the mode of this internship?</strong><br />
The internship mode will be <strong>online only</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>1.4 What are the timings and schedule of this internship?</strong><br />
Internship hours are scheduled between <strong>9:00 AM and 6:00 PM</strong>, from <strong>Monday to Saturday</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2-mode-of-internship--attendance">2. Mode of Internship &amp; Attendance</h2>

<p><strong>2.1 Can we opt for an on-campus/offline internship?</strong><br />
The program will be conducted strictly in <strong>online mode</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>2.2 Is my attendance at online sessions compulsory?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, attendance at every online session is <strong>mandatory</strong>. Attendance will be counted <strong>only if your camera remains ON for the entire Zoom session</strong>. If the camera is not switched on for a sustained duration, the session may <strong>not be considered as full attendance</strong>.</p>

<p>Please note that attendance recorded until now (30.12.2025) is <strong>provisional</strong> and may be reviewed based on camera activity, consistency, and overall participation.</p>

<p>Up to <strong>two warnings</strong> may be issued for non-compliance. Further violations may result in <strong>termination</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>2.3 I registered using one name but attend sessions with a different name or email. Will this affect my attendance?</strong><br />
Yes. You must attend using the <strong>same name and email ID</strong> used during NPTEL registration.</p>

<p><strong>2.4 Should I fill the attendance sheet attached to the NPTEL offer letter?</strong><br />
Yes. You must fill the <strong>Google Form provided in the NPTEL offer letter</strong> <strong>every day</strong> during your internship (<strong>except Sundays</strong>).</p>

<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fill in all required details <strong>daily</strong></li>
  <li>The form should be preferably filled <strong>in the evening</strong>, after completing the day’s work</li>
  <li>This form is <strong>mandatory</strong> for marking your attendance on <strong>NPTEL’s side</strong> throughout the internship</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2.5 I forgot to fill the attendance sheet attached to the NPTEL offer letter yesterday. What should I do now?</strong><br />
Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done, as the form is used for <strong>NPTEL’s official database</strong> and attendance <strong>cannot be recorded for the previous day</strong>. The previous day will be considered as a leave and two such days will automatically lead to termination.</p>

<p>Please ensure that the form is filled <strong>daily</strong> going forward to avoid missing attendance again.</p>

<p><strong>2.6 How can I avail the one-day leave allowed during the internship?</strong><br />
Taking leave is <strong>discouraged</strong>, as you may miss important updates shared during live sessions or fall behind in your progress. It will be <strong>your own responsibility</strong> to complete the work missed on the leave day.</p>

<p>However, if you must take the leave, follow the steps below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write a message in the <strong>main Cliq Channel</strong> stating the reason for your leave</li>
  <li>Tag <strong>@Nitin Sankar A</strong> sir, <strong>@Jinal Gupta</strong> ma’am, and <strong>@Harshdeep R</strong> ma’am in the message</li>
  <li>Post the request <strong>at least one day in advance</strong></li>
  <li>Clearly mention:
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>reason</strong> for the leave</li>
      <li>The <strong>exact date</strong> on which you intend to take the leave</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once submitted, the request will be reviewed and processed by the team.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="3-mentorship--guidance">3. Mentorship &amp; Guidance</h2>

<p><strong>3.1 Will the course instructor supervise our work directly?</strong><br />
The instructor <strong>may interact</strong> with interns depending on project requirements.<br />
Mentors and coordinators will engage via <strong>live sessions</strong> and <strong>forums</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="4-support-and-resolution-protocol">4. Support and Resolution Protocol</h2>

<p><strong>4.1 Where do I raise my concern initially?</strong><br />
Email <strong>internship-support@vicharanashala.zohodesk.in</strong>.<br />
Responses are provided <strong>within 2 hours</strong> between <strong>9:00 AM and 9:00 PM</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>4.2 What if I don’t receive a response within 24 hours?</strong><br />
Raise a <strong>second ticket</strong> with the subject:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Attention Please – Follow-up on Ticket #[Original Ticket Number]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>4.3 Who responds to the second ticket?</strong><br />
The <strong>Mentors Team</strong>, via a <strong>voice call</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>4.4 How do I escalate further?</strong><br />
After <strong>48 hours</strong>, email the <strong>Internship Sponsor</strong>, CC’ing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar</li>
  <li>Faculty reference</li>
  <li>Department HOD</li>
  <li>dled@iitrpr.ac.in</li>
</ul>

<p>Include ticket numbers and dates.</p>

<p><strong>4.5 Why include faculty reference and HOD?</strong><br />
For <strong>transparency</strong>, <strong>accountability</strong>, and faster resolution.</p>

<p><strong>4.6 Is this escalation process mandatory?</strong><br />
Yes. This <strong>three-step process</strong> must be followed.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="5-stipend-and-certification">5. Stipend and Certification</h2>

<p><strong>5.1 Where can I find information on stipend and certification?</strong><br />
Refer to the <strong>official NPTEL website</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>5.2 Will recommendation letters be provided?</strong><br />
Not guaranteed. Issued <strong>at the instructor’s discretion</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="6-completion--certification">6. Completion &amp; Certification</h2>

<p><strong>6.1 What are the internship completion criteria?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>100% attendance</strong> (1 day eligible leave)</li>

<h2 id="7-report-submission--deadline">7. Report Submission &amp; Deadline</h2>

<p><strong>7.1 What happens if I miss deadlines?</strong><br />
Late submissions may result in being <strong>flagged as a defaulter</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="8-termination-appeals--rejoining">8. Termination, Appeals &amp; Rejoining</h2>

<p><strong>8.1 Can I be terminated due to academic overlap (exams, college work, etc.)?</strong><br />
Yes. Any <strong>academic overlap</strong> that affects attendance or participation will result in <strong>termination</strong>, as this internship requires full-time commitment.</p>

<p><strong>8.2 Can I be terminated due to attendance issues?</strong><br />
Yes. Interns who are found to be <strong>fully absent for three or more working days on Zoom</strong>, based on verified and auditable attendance records, may be <strong>removed from the internship</strong>.<br />
Relevant communication regarding such actions is sent <strong>only via official email</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>8.3 Can I appeal a termination related to attendance?</strong><br />
Yes, <strong>only in specific cases</strong>. If you genuinely believe there has been an error in the attendance records and you have attended the sessions as required, you may submit an appeal <strong>exclusively through the official Google Form shared with you via email</strong>.</p>

<p>Please note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Appeals raised on <strong>Cliq or any other platform will not be entertained</strong></li>
  <li>Appeals are accepted <strong>only through the official Google Form</strong></li>
  <li>Each appeal triggers a <strong>detailed re-verification</strong> of Zoom attendance logs and session recordings</li>
</ul>

<p>If, after re-verification, non-attendance is confirmed, the appeal may be viewed as a <strong>lack of due diligence</strong> and an <strong>unnecessary use of institutional time</strong>, and the matter <strong>may be escalated</strong> to the relevant academic authorities for appropriate action.</p>

<p><strong>8.4 What should I do if I receive an email regarding termination or appeal?</strong><br />
If you have received such an email:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kindly <strong>exit the Cliq group</strong></li>
  <li>Continue all further communication <strong>strictly via email</strong></li>
  <li>Follow only the instructions mentioned in the official email</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>8.5 Can I rejoin the internship after termination?</strong><br />
No. Terminations are <strong>final</strong>, and rejoining the same batch is <strong>not permitted</strong>.<br />
You may choose to <strong>reapply for a future batch</strong>, subject to selection and funding availability.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="9-vibe-platform">9. ViBe Platform</h2>

<p><strong>9.1 How do I log in to ViBe?</strong><br />
Invite link → Continue as Student → Continue with Google → Dashboard.</p>

<p><strong>9.2 Invite accepted but shows “No course enrolled”?</strong><br />
Verify email → Check alias → Contact Support.</p>

<p><strong>9.3 Why are videos stuck or repeating?</strong><br />
Sequential viewing, camera/mic access, lighting, and noise conditions matter.</p>

<p><strong>9.4 Can I use mobile or tablet?</strong><br />
No. Only <strong>desktop/laptop</strong> is supported.</p>

<p><strong>9.5 I’m experiencing video issues (stuck, looping, skipping) on ViBe. How do I troubleshoot?</strong><br />
Try these troubleshooting steps in order:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Refresh the page</strong> and check multiple times</li>
  <li><strong>Inspect browser console</strong>: Right-click → Inspect → Go to Network or Console tab → Try watching the video and check for any visible errors</li>
  <li><strong>Log out and log in again</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Use a different browser</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Clear browsing data and cache</strong>, then try to re-login</li>
</ol>

<p>If the issue persists after trying all steps, <strong>record the issue</strong> and email it to: <strong>internship-support@vicharanashala.zohodesk.in</strong> between <strong>9:00 AM and 9:00 PM</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>9.6 I have completed all videos and quizzes in the ViBe course, but my progress is still showing less than 100%. What should I do?</strong></p>

<p>Please do not worry. This is a <strong>dashboard-level technical issue</strong> that has already been acknowledged by the support team and communicated in the Cliq threads. The team is actively working on resolving it, and your progress will be <strong>updated automatically</strong> once the issue is fixed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you may try the following steps once:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Refresh your browser</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Log out</strong>, clear your browser cache, and <strong>log in again</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>If the issue still persists after these steps, no further action is required from your side. Your course completion status will be corrected by the support team shortly.</p>

<p><strong>9.7 What is the deadline to complete the course from the ViBe platform?</strong></p>

<p>The course does not have a single hard deadline. Instead, it is divided into <strong>progress-based milestones</strong>, where learners are required to reach a certain percentage of completion by specific dates.<br />
<strong>Failure to meet these milestones may lead to termination from the program.</strong></p>

<p>The milestones are as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Date</th>
      <th>Required ViBe Progress (≥)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>29 Dec</td>
      <td>20%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>30 Dec</td>
      <td>30%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>31 Dec</td>
      <td>40%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>01 Jan</td>
      <td>50%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>02 Jan</td>
      <td>60%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>03 Jan</td>
      <td>70%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>04 Jan</td>
      <td>80%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>05 Jan</td>
      <td>90%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>06 Jan</td>
      <td>100%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>However, <strong>do not focus only on deadlines</strong>. Meeting milestones is <strong>not the ultimate goal</strong> of this course.<br />
The primary objective is to <strong>introduce you to the MERN stack</strong> and help you build a strong foundation in its core technical concepts — not to create unnecessary pressure.</p>

<p>These milestones are set <strong>only to ensure that learners do not fall behind</strong>, to maintain <strong>steady progress</strong>, and to encourage <strong>healthy competition</strong> while ensuring everyone improves consistently each day.</p>

<p>Treat your learning journey as a <strong>marathon, not a race</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="10-cliq-channel">10. Cliq Channel</h2>

<p><strong>10.1 How do I join the Cliq Channel?</strong><br />
Follow these steps <strong>only on a laptop or desktop</strong> (mobile is not supported):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Check your email for the <strong>Cliq channel invite</strong> and open it.</li>

  <li>In the left navigation bar, select <strong>#Channels</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click on the <strong>Join</strong> button.</li>
  <li>Locate <strong>#NPTEL Winter Internship</strong> and click <strong>Join</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>10.2 I am unable to join the Cliq Channel due to the message<br />
“Collaboration with different regional external users in Zoho Cliq is disabled”. What should I do?</strong></p>

<p>If you face this issue, follow the steps below:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on your <strong>Profile icon</strong> (top-right corner).</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Admin Panel</strong> under <em>My Organization</em>.</li>
  <li>Go to <strong>Policies</strong> under the <em>Permissions</em> section.</li>

  <li>Under <strong>Universal Access</strong>, enable <strong>both checkboxes</strong>.</li>
  <li>Refresh the Cliq page and try joining the channel again.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the issue persists, take a <strong>screenshot or screen recording</strong> clearly showing the error message, briefly explain the problem, and email it to:<br />
<strong>internship-support@vicharanashala.zohodesk.in</strong> between <strong>9:00 AM and 9:00 PM</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>10.3 I have joined the Cliq Channel but I am unable to message in it. What should I do?</strong></p>

<p>This issue is usually caused by restricted collaboration permissions.</p>

<p>Follow the steps mentioned in <strong>10.2</strong> to enable <strong>Universal Access</strong>, then refresh the page.</p>

<p>If you are still unable to send messages, take a <strong>screenshot or screen recording</strong> of the issue, briefly explain the problem, and email it to:<br />
<strong>internship-support@vicharanashala.zohodesk.in</strong> between <strong>9:00 AM and 9:00 PM</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>10.4 How do I update my profile picture so everyone can view it?</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Open <strong>Zoho Cliq</strong> on desktop.</li>
  <li>Click your <strong>Profile icon</strong> (top-right corner).</li>
  <li>Click <strong>My Zoho Account</strong> next to the <em>Sign Out</em> button.</li>
  <li>Authorize using <strong>Google</strong>.</li>
  <li>Go to <strong>Settings → Preferences</strong>.</li>
  <li>Set <strong>Profile Picture Visibility</strong> to <strong>Anyone</strong>.</li>
  <li>Return to Cliq and <strong>refresh the page</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click your <strong>Profile icon</strong> again and upload a <strong>clear profile picture</strong> where your face is properly visible.</li>
  <li>Refresh the page once more and <strong>wait for some time</strong>, as it may take a while for the updated profile picture to become visible to everyone.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>10.5 How can I use the Cliq Channel effectively?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask queries only in the <strong>designated Cliq channel</strong>.</li>
  <li>Reply <strong>only within the relevant thread</strong>, not in the main channel.</li>
  <li>Avoid direct messages unless explicitly instructed.</li>
  <li>Help peers whenever possible in the relevant thread to earn <strong>health points</strong>.</li>
  <li>Before posting a query, check recent threads to see if the same question has already been asked.</li>
  <li>While reacting to messages, use:
    <ul>
      <li>👍 to acknowledge a query as soon as it is submitted</li>
      <li>✅ to mark a query as resolved</li>
      <li>🔔 for FYI or informational updates</li>
      <li>➕ if you are facing the same issue</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These practices help maintain clarity and ensure no updates are missed.</p>

<p><strong>10.6 I’m having issues with profile pictures on Cliq Channel. What should I do?</strong></p>

<p>If you’re facing profile picture issues, try these troubleshooting steps:</p>

<p><strong>For specific user profile picture issues:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <strong>accounts.zoho.com</strong></li>
  <li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong></li>
  <li>Check whether the <strong>Profile Picture Visibility</strong> is set to:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>“Only users in my organization”</strong> or</li>
      <li><strong>“Everyone”</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>If you cannot see any user profile pictures:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Hard-refresh your browser</strong> and <strong>clear cookies and cache</strong></li>
  <li>Follow this guide: https://help.codehs.com/en/articles/4951972-how-to-clear-your-browser-cache-and-hard-refresh</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>If issues still persist:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>This may be due to your <strong>data center being mapped to US instead of India</strong></li>
  <li>Send an email with detailed issue description to: <strong>support@zohocliq.com</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="11-github-assignment-submission">11. GitHub Assignment Submission</h2>

<p><strong>11.1 How do I submit my GitHub assignment?</strong></p>

<p>Video guide: https://youtu.be/lrpjRo9Z02Y</p>

<p>Steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Accept the assignment</li>
  <li>The repository will be <strong>automatically created</strong></li>
  <li>Read the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file carefully to understand:
    <ul>
      <li>what you need to do for the assignment, and</li>
      <li>which files you are allowed to modify</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Make the necessary changes</li>
  <li>Commit and push your changes to GitHub</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>11.2 I am unable to open my assignment. What should I do?</strong><br />
Try these solutions:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Direct GitHub editing</strong>: Open the source file directly on GitHub and edit it there</li>
  <li><strong>Wait for VS Code loading</strong>: If using VS Code, wait for the assignment to fully load (this may take some time)</li>
  <li><strong>Clone locally</strong>: Use VS Code to clone the repository to your local folder, make changes locally, then push to GitHub</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>11.3 How do auto-graded assignments work?</strong><br />
Auto-graded assignments are automatically evaluated each time you commit your code:</p>

<ul>
  <li>After completing and committing your assignment, look for a <strong>green tick mark</strong> indicating successful grading</li>
  <li>Navigate to <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> tab in your repository to check the auto-grading workflow status</li>
  <li>A <strong>green tick</strong> means your code passed all test cases</li>
  <li>A <strong>red cross</strong> indicates your code has errors or failed some test cases</li>
  <li><strong>Every commit triggers auto-grading</strong>, so you can fix issues and commit again until you get the green tick</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="13-mern-case-studies">13. MERN Case Studies</h2>

<p><strong>13.1 What are Case Studies?</strong><br />
Case studies are <strong>well-structured, documentation-based lessons</strong> designed to help you apply what you have learned through <strong>hands-on coding</strong>. Each case study focuses on real-world problem-solving, collaborative thinking, and practical implementation to help you become more confident with the technologies covered in the ViBe course.</p>

<p>Case studies are organized by technology, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>TypeScript Fundamentals</li>
  <li>React Development</li>
  <li>Express.js Backend</li>
  <li>MongoDB Database</li>
</ul>

<p>Each case study includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clear problem statements</li>
  <li>Defined learning objectives</li>
  <li>Step-by-step explanations</li>
  <li>Practical coding tasks</li>
  <li>Best practices and recommended patterns</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>13.2 How do I get started with Case Studies?</strong><br />
You can get started with case studies by following these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the <strong>Case Studies</strong> link in the navigation bar at the top of the page.</li>
  <li>Select a <strong>technology</strong> and then choose a <strong>lesson</strong>.</li>
  <li>Read the entire documentation carefully to understand the concept and tasks to be performed.</li>
  <li>Open a code editor (for example, <strong>VS Code</strong>) and implement the tasks in a <strong>single file</strong>, unless specified otherwise.</li>
  <li>Upload the file along with your details for each lesson using the provided submission link.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>13.3 How do I submit the case studies?</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Visit the submission form:<br />
https://forms.zohopublic.in/annamai1/form/MERNCASEStudyChallenge/formperma/vSrDY7Uw2l5mw7UIAUk2gh2SCOryplPMeU7IncHhSX0</li>
  <li>Fill in all required details carefully, including:
    <ul>
      <li>First name and last name</li>
      <li>Email ID associated with the internship</li>
      <li>Technology name and lesson number completed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Upload the file containing your solution<br />
(supported formats include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.js</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ts</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.txt</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.zip</code>, etc.)</li>
  <li>Review your details and submit the form.</li>
  <li>Repeat this process for <strong>each lesson</strong> you complete.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>13.4 What should I do if a lesson contains multiple files?</strong><br />
For lessons (such as React) that involve <strong>multiple files</strong>, compress all related files into a <strong>single ZIP file</strong> and upload the ZIP file during submission.</p>

<p><strong>13.5 Where can I get help if I am stuck with the case studies?</strong><br />
If you are facing difficulties, feel free to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Join the <strong>breakout rooms</strong> during Zoom sessions</li>
  <li>Collaborate and discuss solutions with your peers</li>
</ul>

<p>This collaborative approach is encouraged to enhance learning and problem-solving skills.</p>

<p><strong>13.6 Where can I view my submission status and access the leaderboard and dashboard?</strong><br />
You can track your submission status, access the leaderboard, and view the dashboard by visiting the following link:<br />
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vOQY7BYRMmNiSCBkzrYR-b-1r54jViEmzvL9nD12PoI/edit?gid=2050387016#gid=2050387016</p>

<p><strong>13.7 What is the deadline to complete the MERN case studies?</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>hard deadline</strong> to complete all MERN case studies is <strong>4th January 2026 (Sunday) evening</strong>.</p>

<p>However, do <strong>not focus solely on the deadline</strong>. Meeting the deadline is <strong>not the ultimate goal</strong> of these case studies.<br />
Their primary purpose is to give you exposure to <strong>collaborative problem-solving</strong>, <strong>hands-on coding</strong>, and to help <strong>optimize your learning journey</strong>, rather than forcing you to rush through tasks.</p>

<p>The deadline is set only to ensure that learners <strong>do not fall behind</strong>, to maintain <strong>consistent progress</strong>, and to promote <strong>healthy competition</strong> while ensuring everyone improves day by day.</p>

<p>Make your learning journey a <strong>marathon, not a race</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="14-vivapes-endorsements">14. Viva/PES (Endorsements)</h2>

<p><strong>14.1 How will the viva/evaluation process be conducted?</strong><br />
Each intern is required to <strong>select at least 5 evaluators (other interns)</strong> who will evaluate their work, primarily based on their <strong>case studies</strong> solutions. Hence, make sure you are completed with all the Case studies before you evaluate someone or get evaluated yourself.</p>

<p><strong>14.2 What is the role of the evaluators?</strong><br />
The evaluators are expected to be <strong>sincere</strong> and give their <strong>best effort</strong> while evaluating the case studies.<br />
The evaluation is mainly an <strong>endorsement of learning</strong>, not a formal grading process.</p>

<p><strong>14.3 Will the evaluations be verified?</strong><br />
Yes. The team will <strong>randomly second-check</strong> evaluated case studies.<br />
If any <strong>anomaly</strong> is detected, the following actions may be taken:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Re-evaluation of the evaluated intern’s case studies</li>
  <li>Re-evaluation of the evaluator’s own case studies</li>
  <li>Re-evaluation of all case studies previously evaluated by that evaluator</li>
</ul>

<p>To avoid such an <strong>anomaly cascade</strong>, choose your evaluators carefully.</p>

<p><strong>14.4 Can two interns evaluate each other?</strong><br />
No. If <strong>A evaluates B</strong>, then <strong>B cannot evaluate A</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>14.5 Can I choose evaluators from my own institute?</strong><br />
Preferably, <strong>no</strong>.<br />
Choosing evaluators from your own institute may raise a <strong>first level of suspicion</strong>. While this is <strong>discouraged</strong>, it is <strong>not enforced as a strict rule</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>14.6 How many evaluators do I need?</strong><br />
You need <strong>exactly 5 evaluators to endorse you</strong>.<br />
If any selected person is unwilling to endorse you, you must <strong>find a replacement</strong>.<br />
Overall, you must ensure that <strong>at least 5 people endorse your learning</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>14.7 What does the endorsement involve?</strong><br />
Your evaluators will fill out a <strong>Google Form</strong> stating that they <strong>endorse your learning</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is <strong>no rating or scoring</strong></li>
  <li>Evaluators may add <strong>optional comments</strong></li>
  <li>Endorsements will be submitted through a form that will be <strong>displayed on the dashboard</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>14.8 When should the evaluation be done?</strong><br />
It is recommended to evaluate <strong>only after completing all case studies</strong> or once you are <strong>confident in the concepts</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>14.9 Do we need to record our evaluation interactions?</strong><br />
No. You only need to <strong>interact and endorse</strong> the person.<br />
How you conduct the interaction is <strong>entirely up to you</strong>. No recordings are required.</p>

<p><strong>14.10 Can I appeal an endorsement decision?</strong><br />
No.<br />
This is intentional, as interns are expected to choose <strong>trustworthy evaluators</strong> who will endorse them <strong>honestly and fairly</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>14.11 Can I evaluate more than 5 people?</strong><br />
Yes.<br />
You must be evaluated by <strong>exactly 5 people</strong>, but you may <strong>evaluate as many interns as you wish</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>14.12 What if I want to remove an endorsement or someone endorses me without my consent?</strong><br />
You will be provided with a <strong>separate form</strong> that allows you to <strong>remove an endorsement</strong> made by a particular person.</p>

<p><strong>14.13 What if I evaluate many people but struggle to find evaluators for myself?</strong><br />
The teaching team <strong>appreciates interns who evaluate many peers</strong>.<br />
In such cases, <strong>teaching team members</strong> can be requested to act as your evaluators.</p>

<p>Additionally, <strong>Silver and Golden Tickets</strong> will be issued to selected interns.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Interns receiving these tickets <strong>do not need peer evaluation</strong></li>
  <li>They will be <strong>directly evaluated by Sudarshan sir and the teaching team</strong></li>
  <li>Anyone who endorses <strong>more than 25 people</strong> will be evaluated by the Teaching Team and will be issued a Silver Ticket.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>14.14 How do I earn a Silver ticket?</strong><br />
Anyone who endorses <strong>more than 25 people</strong> will be evaluated by the Teaching Team and will be issued a Silver Ticket.</p>
